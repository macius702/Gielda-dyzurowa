>>>>>>>>>> User Prompt >>>>>>>>>>
Your task is to talk to a new client and develop a detailed specification for a new application the client wants to build. This specification will serve as an input to an AI software developer and thus must be very detailed, contain all the project functionality and precisely define behaviour, 3rd-party integrations (if any), etc.

The AI developer prefers working on web apps using Node/Express/MongoDB/Mongoose/EJS stack, and use vanilla JS with Bootstrap on the frontend, unless the client has different requirements.
Try to avoid the use of Docker, Kubernetes, microservices and single-page app frameworks like React, Next.js, Angular, Vue or Svelte unless the brief explicitly requires it.

In your work, follow these important rules:
* In your communication with the client, be straightforward, concise, and focused on the task.
* Ask questions ONE BY ONE. This is veryy important, as the client is easily confused. If you were to ask multiple questions the user would probably miss some questions, so remember to always ask the questions one by one
* Ask specific questions, taking into account what you already know about the project. For example, don't ask "what features do you need?" or "describe your idea"; instead ask "what is the most important feature?"
* Pay special attention to any documentation or information that the project might require (such as accessing a custom API, etc). Be sure to ask the user to provide information and examples that the developers will need to build the proof-of-concept. You will need to output all of this in the final specification.
* This is a a prototype project, it is important to have small and well-defined scope. If the scope seems to grow too large (beyond a week or two of work for one developer), ask the user if they can simplify the project.
* Do not address non-functional requirements (performance, deployment, security, budget, timelines, etc...). We are only concerned with functional and technical specification here.
* Do not address deployment or hosting, including DevOps tasks to set up a CI/CD pipeline
* Don't address or invision any future development (post proof-of-concept), the scope of your task is to only spec the PoC/prototype.
* If the user provided specific information on how to access 3rd party API or how exactly to implement something, you MUST include that in the specification. Remember, the AI developer will only have access to the specification you write.

Ensure that you have all the information about:
* overall description and goals for the app
* all the features of the application
* functional specification
    * how the user will use the app
    * enumerate all the parts of the application (eg. pages of the application, background processing if any, etc); for each part, explain *in detail* how it should work from the perspective of the user
    * identify any constraints, business rules, user flows or other important info that affect how the application works or how it is used
* technical specification
    * what kind of an application this is and what platform/technologies will be used
    * the architecture of the application (what happens on backend, frontend, mobile, background tasks, integration with 3rd party services, etc)
    * detailed description of each component of the application architecture
* integration specification
    * any 3rd party apps, services, APIs that will be used (eg. for auth, payments, etc..)
    * if a custom API is used, precise definitions, with examples, how to use the custom API or do the custom integration

If you identify any missing information or need clarification on any vague or ambiguous parts of the brief, ask the client about it.

Important note: don't ask trivial questions for obvious or unimportant parts of the app, for example:
* Bad questions example 1:
  * Client brief: I want to build a hello world web app
  * Bad questions:
    * What title do you want for the web page that displays "Hello World"?
    * What color and font size would you like for the "Hello World" text to be displayed in?
    * Should the "Hello World" message be static text served directly from the server, or would you like it implemented via JavaScript on the client side?
  * Explanation: There's no need to micromanage the developer(s) and designer(s), the client would've specified these details if they were important.

If you ask such trivial questions, the client will think you're stupid and will leave. DOn'T DO THAT

Think carefully about what a developer must know to be able to build the app. The specification must address all of this information, otherwise the AI software developer will not be able to build the app.

When you gather all the information from the client, output the complete specification. Remember, the specification should define both functional aspects (features - what it does, what the user should be able to do), the technical details (architecture, technologies preferred by the user, etc), and the integration details (pay special attention to describe these in detail). Include all important features and clearly describe how each feature should function. IMPORTANT: Do not add any preamble (eg. "Here's the specification....") or conclusion/commentary (eg. "Let me know if you have further questions")!

Here's an EXAMPLE initial prompt:
---start-of-example-output---
Online forum similar to Hacker News (news.ycombinator.com), with a simple and clean interface, where people can post links or text posts, and other people can upvote, downvote and comment on. Reading is open to anonymous users, but users must register to post, upvote, downvote or comment. Use simple username+password authentication. The forum should be implemented in Node.js with Express framework, using MongoDB and Mongoose ORM.

The UI should use EJS view engine, Bootstrap for styling and plain vanilla JavaScript. Design should be simple and look like Hacker News, with a top bar for navigation, using a blue color scheme instead of the orange color in HN. The footer in each page should just be "Built using GPT Pilot".

Each story has a title (one-line text), a link (optional, URL to an external article being shared on AI News), and text (text to show in the post). Link and text are mutually exclusive - if the submitter tries to use both, show them an error.

Use the following algorithm to rank top stories, and comments within a story: "score = upvotes - downvotes + comments - sqrt(age)" , where "upvotes" and "downvotes" are the number of upvotes and downvotes the story or comment has, "comments" is the number of comments for a story (total), or the number of sub-comments (for a comment), and "age" is how old is the story, in minutes, and "sqrt" is the square root function.

Implement the following pages:

* / - shows the top 20 posted stories, ranked using the scoring algorithm, with a "More" link that shows the next 20 (pagination using "p" query parameter), and so on
* /newest - shows the latest 20 posted stories, ranked chronologically (newest first), with a "More" link that shows the next 20 (pagination using "p" query parameter), and so on
* /submit - shows a form to submit a new story, upon submitting the user should get redirected to /newest
* /login - shows a login form (username, password, "login" button, and a link to register page for new users)
* /register - shows a register form (username, password, "register" button, and a link to login page for existing users)
* /item - shows the story (use "id" query parameter to pass the story ID to this route)
* /comment - shows the form to send a comment  (just a textarea and "submit" button) - upon commenting, the person should get redirected to the story they commented on

The / and /newest pages should show the story title (link to the external article if "link" is set, otherwise link to the story item /item page), number of points (points = upvotes - downvotes), poster username (no link), how old is the story ("x minutes ago", "y hours ago" or "z days ago"), and "xyz comments" (link to /item page of the story). This is basically the same how HN shows it.

The /item page should also follow the layout for HN in how it shows the story, and the comments tree. Instead of the embedded "reply" form, the story should just have a "comment" button that goes to the /comment page, similar to the "reply" link underneath each comment. Both should link to the /comment page.
---end-of-example-output---

Remember, this is important: the AI developer will not have access to client's initial description and transcript of your conversation. The developer will only see the specification you output on the end. It is very important that the spec captures *all* the details of the project in as much detail and precision as possible.

Note: after the client reads the specification you create, the client might have additional comments or suggestions. In this case, continue the discussion with the user until you get all the new information and output the newly updated spec again.

Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application aims to facilitate the matching of available doctors to hospital duties. Its primary function is to allow hospitals to publish available duty slots and for doctors to view these vacancies and indicate their interest in taking up a duty. The duties in question are overnight shifts. The application will serve two main roles: hospitals and doctors. Both roles will register with their specialty and location included in their profiles.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform.
   - During registration, both hospitals and doctors must provide their **specialty** and **localization**.
   - **Doctors** can also post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** have the ability to publish slots for overnight duties on a day-to-day basis. Each slot publication should include the **date**, **duty hours**, and **specialty required**.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the listed duty slots and send a message to the hospitals to indicate their interest in taking up a specific duty. 
   - **Doctors** can also post their availability, which hospitals can review.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - **Hospitals** can view the profiles of doctors who send messages to take a duty. Profile viewing is one-way; **doctors cannot view detailed hospital profiles**.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Once a duty slot is filled, any further communication regarding the duty (e.g., specifics of the duty, reporting time) is expected to occur externally (e.g., through email or phone).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application.

Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application aims to facilitate the matching of available doctors to hospital duties. Its primary function is to allow hospitals to publish available duty slots and for doctors to view these vacancies and indicate their interest in taking up a duty. The duties in question are overnight shifts. The application will serve two main roles: hospitals and doctors. Both roles will register with their specialty and location included in their profiles.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform.
   - During registration, both hospitals and doctors must provide their **specialty** and **localization**.
   - **Doctors** can also post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** have the ability to publish slots for overnight duties on a day-to-day basis. Each slot publication should include the **date**, **duty hours**, and **specialty required**.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the listed duty slots and send a message to the hospitals to indicate their interest in taking up a specific duty. 
   - **Doctors** can also post their availability, which hospitals can review.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - **Hospitals** can view the profiles of doctors who send messages to take a duty. Profile viewing is one-way; **doctors cannot view detailed hospital profiles**.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Once a duty slot is filled, any further communication regarding the duty (e.g., specifics of the duty, reporting time) is expected to occur externally (e.g., through email or phone).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application.
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with Express framework, MongoDB for database, Mongoose ORM for MongoDB object modeling, EJS for templating, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.

You're designing the architecture and technical specifications for a new project.

If the project requirements call out for specific technology, use that. Otherwise, if working on a web app, prefer Node.js for the backend (with Express if a web server is needed, and MongoDB if a database is needed), and Bootstrap for the front-end. You MUST NOT use Docker, Kubernetes, microservices and single-page app frameworks like React, Next.js, Angular, Vue or Svelte unless the project details explicitly require it.

Here are the details for the new project:

-----------------------------

Based on these details, think step by step to design the architecture for the project and choose technologies to use in building it.

1. First, design and describe project architecture in general terms
2. Then, list any system dependencies that should be installed on the system prior to start of development.  For each system depedency, output a Linux command to check whether it's installed.
3. Finally, list any other 3rd party packages or libraries that will be used (that will be installed later using packager a package manager in the project repository/environment).
4. Optionally, choose a project starter template.

You have an option to use a project template that implements standard boilerplate/scaffolding so you can start faster and be more productive. To be considered, a template must be compatible with the architecture and technologies you've choosen (it doesn't need to implement everything that will be used in the project, just a useful subset). If multiple templates can be considered, pick one that's the best match.

If no project templates are a good match, don't pick any! It's better to start from scratch than to use a template that is not a good fit for the project and then spend time reworking it to fit the requirements.

Here are the available project templates:

### node_express_mongoose
Node + Express + MongoDB web app with session-based authentication, EJS views and Bootstrap 5

Contains:
* initial Node + Express setup
* User model in Mongoose ORM with username and password fields, ensuring username is unique and hashing passwords with bcrypt prior to saving to the database
* session-based authentication using username + password (hashed using bcrypt) in routes/authRoutes.js, using express-session
* authentication middleware to protect routes that require login
* EJS view engine, html head, header and footer EJS partials, with included Boostrap 5.x CSS and JS
* routes and EJS views for login, register, and home (main) page
* config loading from environment using dotenv with a placeholder .env.example file: you will need to create a .env file with your own values


*IMPORTANT*: You must follow these rules while creating your project:

* You must only list *system* dependencies, ie. the ones that need to be installed (typically as admin) to set up the programming language, database, etc. Any packages that will need to be installed via language/platform-specific package managers are *not* system dependencies.
* If there are several popular options (such as Nginx or Apache for web server), pick one that would be more suitable for the app in question.
* DO NOT include text editors, IDEs, shells, OpenSSL, CLI tools such as git, AWS, or Stripe clients, or other utilities in your list. only direct dependencies required to build and run the project.
* If a dependency (such as database) has a cloud alternative or can be installed on another computer (ie. isn't required on this computer), you must mark it as `required_locally: false`

Output only your response in JSON format like in this example, without other commentary:

You are working in a software development agency and a project manager and software architect approach you telling you that you're assigned to work on a new project. You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to create a detailed development plan so that developers can start developing the app.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Here is a short description of the project architecture:
The Giełda_dyżurowa application will follow a traditional three-tier web application architecture, consisting of a presentation layer (frontend), an application layer (backend), and a data layer (database). The frontend will be built using EJS for templating, Bootstrap for CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for interactions, providing a responsive user interface for both doctors and hospitals to interact with. The backend will be developed using Node.js and the Express framework, handling all business logic, including user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties. MongoDB, coupled with Mongoose ORM, will be used as the database to store and manage user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts efficiently.

Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

* Node.js - JavaScript runtime for building apps. This is required to be able to run the app you're building.
* MongoDB - NoSQL database. If you don't want to install MongoDB locally, you can use a cloud version such as MongoDB Atlas.
* express - Express web server for Node
* mongoose - Mongoose ORM for MongoDB
* bcrypt - Library for hashing passwords
* express-session - Middleware for session management in Express
* dotenv - Module to load environment variables from a .env file
* ejs - Templating engine for rendering views



The developers have already used a project scaffolding tool that creates the initial boilerplate for the project:
The code so far includes:
* initial Node + Express setup
* User model in Mongoose ORM with username and password fields, ensuring username is unique and hashing passwords with bcrypt prior to saving to the database
* session-based authentication using username + password (hashed using bcrypt) in routes/authRoutes.js, using express-session
* authentication middleware to protect routes that require login
* EJS view engine, html head, header and footer EJS partials, with included Boostrap 5.x CSS and JS
* routes and EJS views for login, register, and home (main) page
* config loading from environment using dotenv with a placeholder .env.example file: you will need to create a .env file with your own values

Here are files that are currently implemented:

Before we go into the coding part, I want you to split the development process of creating this app into smaller tasks so that it is easier to develop, debug and make the app work.

Each task needs to be related only to the development of this app and nothing else - once the app is fully working, that is it. There shouldn't be a task for researching, deployment, writing documentation, testing or anything that is not writing the actual code.

**IMPORTANT**
As an experienced tech lead you always follow rules on how to create tasks. Dividing project into tasks is extremely important job and you have to do it very carefully.

Now, based on the project details provided, think task by task and create the entire development plan. Continue from the existing code listed above and specify each task until the moment when the entire app should be fully working. You should not reimplement what's already done - just continue from the implementation already there while strictly following these rules:

Rule #1
There should never be a task that is only testing or ensuring something works, every task must have coding involved. Have this in mind for every task, but it is extremely important for last task of project. Testing if app works will be done as part of each task.

Rule #2
This rule applies to the complexity of tasks.
You have to make sure the project is not split into tasks that are too small or simple for no reason but also not too big or complex so that they are hard to develop, debug and review.
Have in mind that project already has workspace folder created and only system dependencies installed. You don't have to create tasks for that.
Here are examples of poorly created tasks:

**too simple tasks**
- Set up a Node.js project and install all necessary dependencies.
- Establish a MongoDB database connection using Mongoose with the IP '127.0.0.1'.

**too complex tasks**
- Set up Node.js project with /home, /profile, /register and /login routes that will have user authentication, connection to MongoDB with user schemas, mailing of new users and frontend with nice design.

You must to avoid creating tasks that are too simple or too complex. You have to aim to create tasks that are medium complexity. Here are examples of tasks that are good:

**good tasks**
- Set up a Node.js project, install all necessary dependencies and set up an express server with a simple route to `/ping` that returns the status 200.
- Establish a MongoDB database connection and implement the message schema using Mongoose for persistent storage of messages.

Rule #3
This rule applies to the number of tasks you will create.
Every app should have different number of tasks depending on complexity. Think task by task and create the minimum number of tasks that are relevant for this specific app. Here are some examples of apps with different complexity that can give you guidance on how many tasks you should create:

Example #1:
app description: "I want to create an app that will just say 'Hello World' when I open it on my localhost:3000."
number of tasks: 1-2

Example #2:
app description: "Create a node.js app that enables users to register and log into the app. On frontend it should have /home (shows user data), /register and /login. It should use sessions to keep user logged in."
number of tasks: 2-4

Example #3:
app description: "A cool online shoe store, with a sleek look. In terms of data models, there are shoes, categories and user profiles. For web pages: product listing, details, shopping cart. It must look cool and jazzy."
number of tasks: 5-15

Rule #4
This rule applies to writing task 'description'.
Every task must have a clear and very detailed (must be minimum of 4 sentences but can be more) 'description'. It must be very clear so that even developers who just moved to this project can execute them without additional questions. It is not enough to just write something like "Create a route for /home". You have to describe what needs to be done in that route, what data needs to be returned, what should be the status code, etc. Give as many details as possible and make sure no information is missing that could be needed for this task.
Here is an example of good and bad task description:

**bad task**
{
    "description": "Create a route for /dashboard"
}

**good task**
{
    "description": "In 'route.js' add a route for /dashboard that returns the status 200. Route should be accessible only for logged in users. In 'middlewares.js' there should be a check if user is logged in using session. If user is not logged in, it should redirect to /login. If user is logged in, it should return the user data. User data should be fetched from database in 'users' collection using the user id from session."
}

Rule #5

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for "Giełda_dyżurowa" as well.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

```

Here is a short description of the project architecture:
The Giełda_dyżurowa application will follow a traditional three-tier web application architecture, consisting of a presentation layer (frontend), an application layer (backend), and a data layer (database). The frontend will be built using EJS for templating, Bootstrap for CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for interactions, providing a responsive user interface for both doctors and hospitals to interact with. The backend will be developed using Node.js and the Express framework, handling all business logic, including user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties. MongoDB, coupled with Mongoose ORM, will be used as the database to store and manage user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts efficiently.

Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

* Node.js - JavaScript runtime for building apps. This is required to be able to run the app you're building.
* MongoDB - NoSQL database. If you don't want to install MongoDB locally, you can use a cloud version such as MongoDB Atlas.
* express - Express web server for Node
* mongoose - Mongoose ORM for MongoDB
* bcrypt - Library for hashing passwords
* express-session - Middleware for session management in Express
* dotenv - Module to load environment variables from a .env file
* ejs - Templating engine for rendering views



Here are files that are currently implemented:

We've broken the development of this app down to these tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```

You are currently working on task #1 with the following description:
```
Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields.

Now, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands that need to be run to implement this task.

**IMPORTANT**
Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.

DO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written. When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."
------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**
When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file.

Never use the port 5000 to run the app, it's reserved.

To implement the task of Hospital and Doctor registration functionality, we will modify the `User` model, update the registration view, and adjust the POST `/auth/register` route accordingly.

### Step 1: Modify the User Model
Update the `User` model to include a `role`, `specialty`, and `localization` fields. The `role` field is required for both doctors and hospitals, but `specialty` and `localization` are required for doctors only.

**File: models/User.js**
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  role: { type: String, required: true, enum: ['doctor', 'hospital'] }, // Add role field
  specialty: { type: String }, // Add specialty field
  localization: { type: String } // Add localization field
});

userSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  const user = this;
  if (!user.isModified('password')) return next();
  bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10, (err, hash) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error hashing password:', err);
      return next(err);
    }
    user.password = hash;
    next();
  });
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

module.exports = User;
```

### Step 2: Update Registration View
Add inputs for `role`, `specialty`, and `localization` in the registration view. Use conditional logic to display `specialty` and `localization` fields only if the selected role is `doctor`.

**File: views/register.ejs**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<%- include('partials/_head.ejs') %>
<body>
<%- include('partials/_header.ejs') %>
<main role="main">
  <div class="container mt-5">
    <h2>Register</h2>
    <form action="/auth/register" method="POST">
      <div class="mb-3">
        <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" required class="form-control">
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required class="form-control">
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        <select name="role" required class="form-control">
          <option value="">Select Role</option>
          <option value="doctor">Doctor</option>
          <option value="hospital">Hospital</option>
        </select>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        <input type="text" name="specialty" placeholder="Specialty (Doctors only)" class="form-control">
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        <input type="text" name="localization" placeholder="Localization (Doctors only)" class="form-control">
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary mr-2">Register</button>
        Already have an account? <a href="/auth/login">Login</a>
      </div>
    </form>
  </div>
</main>
</body>
<%- include('partials/_footer.ejs') %>
</html>
```

### Step 3: Modify POST `/auth/register` Route
Adjust the route to handle the new fields. Ensure `specialty` and `localization` are required for doctors only.

**File: routes/authRoutes.js**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const User = require('../models/User');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const router = express.Router();

// Existing code for /auth/register GET route

router.post('/auth/register', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { username, password, role, specialty, localization } = req.body;
    // Validate specialty and localization for doctors
    if(role === 'doctor' && (!specialty || !localization)) {
      throw new Error('Specialty and Localization are required for doctors.');
    }
    await User.create({ username, password, role, specialty, localization });
    res.redirect('/auth/login');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Registration error:', error);
    res.status(500).send(error.message);
  }
});

// Existing code for /auth/login GET and POST routes
// Existing code for /auth/logout GET route

module.exports = router;
```

These modifications and additions should implement the requested functionality for Hospital and Doctor registration, handling the new fields appropriately based on the user's role.

To implement the task of Hospital and Doctor registration functionality, we will modify the `User` model, update the registration view, and adjust the POST `/auth/register` route accordingly.

### Step 1: Modify the User Model
Update the `User` model to include a `role`, `specialty`, and `localization` fields. The `role` field is required for both doctors and hospitals, but `specialty` and `localization` are required for doctors only.

**File: models/User.js**
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  role: { type: String, required: true, enum: ['doctor', 'hospital'] }, // Add role field
  specialty: { type: String }, // Add specialty field
  localization: { type: String } // Add localization field
});

userSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  const user = this;
  if (!user.isModified('password')) return next();
  bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10, (err, hash) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error hashing password:', err);
      return next(err);
    }
    user.password = hash;
    next();
  });
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

module.exports = User;
```

### Step 2: Update Registration View
Add inputs for `role`, `specialty`, and `localization` in the registration view. Use conditional logic to display `specialty` and `localization` fields only if the selected role is `doctor`.

**File: views/register.ejs**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<%- include('partials/_head.ejs') %>
<body>
<%- include('partials/_header.ejs') %>
<main role="main">
  <div class="container mt-5">
    <h2>Register</h2>
    <form action="/auth/register" method="POST">
      <div class="mb-3">
        <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" required class="form-control">
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">

      <div class="mb-3">

          <option value="doctor">Doctor</option>
          <option value="hospital">Hospital</option>
        </select>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        <input type="text" name="specialty" placeholder="Specialty (Doctors only)" class="form-control">
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        <input type="text" name="localization" placeholder="Localization (Doctors only)" class="form-control">
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary mr-2">Register</button>
        Already have an account? <a href="/auth/login">Login</a>
      </div>
    </form>
  </div>
</main>
</body>
<%- include('partials/_footer.ejs') %>
</html>
```

### Step 3: Modify POST `/auth/register` Route
Adjust the route to handle the new fields. Ensure `specialty` and `localization` are required for doctors only.

**File: routes/authRoutes.js**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const User = require('../models/User');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const router = express.Router();

// Existing code for /auth/register GET route

router.post('/auth/register', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { username, password, role, specialty, localization } = req.body;
    // Validate specialty and localization for doctors
    if(role === 'doctor' && (!specialty || !localization)) {
      throw new Error('Specialty and Localization are required for doctors.');
    }
    await User.create({ username, password, role, specialty, localization });
    res.redirect('/auth/login');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Registration error:', error);
    res.status(500).send(error.message);
  }
});

// Existing code for /auth/login GET and POST routes
// Existing code for /auth/logout GET route

module.exports = router;
```

These modifications and additions should implement the requested functionality for Hospital and Doctor registration, handling the new fields appropriately based on the user's role.

>>>>>>>>>> User Prompt >>>>>>>>>>
Ok, now, take your previous message that starts with `To implement the task of` and ends with `based on the user's role.` and convert it to a list of actionable steps that will be executed by a machine. Analyze the entire message, think step by step and make sure that you don't omit any information when converting this message to steps.

Each step can be either:

* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a Linux machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)
* `save_file` - create or update ONE file
* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done. Also you MUST NOT use `human_intervention` to ask the human to write or review code.

**IMPORTANT**: In `code_change_description` field of `save_file` step, you must provide empty string. If multiple changes are required for same file, you must provide single `save_file` step for each file.

When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember, NEVER output human intervention steps to do manual tests or coding tasks, even if the previous message asks for it! The testing will be done *after* these steps and you MUST NOT include testing in these steps.

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true }
});

userSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  const user = this;
  if (!user.isModified('password')) return next();
  bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10, (err, hash) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error hashing password:', err);
      return next(err);
    }
    user.password = hash;
    next();
  });
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

module.exports = User;
```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/models/User.js`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true }
});

userSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  const user = this;
  if (!user.isModified('password')) return next();
  bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10, (err, hash) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error hashing password:', err);
      return next(err);
    }
    user.password = hash;
    next();
  });
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

module.exports = User;
```

Here is the diff of the changes:

## Hunk 1

```


As you can see, there are 2 hunks in this diff, and each starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/models/User.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:\n* applied - if the change is correct\n* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn\'t asked for\n* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect\n\nFinally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you\'re just reviewing one file, `/models/User.js`. You don\'t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.\n\nNote that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that\'s not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don\'t ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it\'s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 2,\n            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 3,\n            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",\n            "decision": "ignore"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 4,\n            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",\n            "decision": "rework"\n        },\n    ],\n    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted.

<%- include('partials/_header.ejs') %>

```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

As you can see, there are 2 hunks in this diff, and each starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/views/register.ejs`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:\n* applied - if the change is correct\n* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn\'t asked for\n* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect\n\nFinally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you\'re just reviewing one file, `/views/register.ejs`. You don\'t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.\n\nNote that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that\'s not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don\'t ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it\'s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important.

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

As you can see, there are 3 hunks in this diff, and each starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/routes/authRoutes.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:\n* applied - if the change is correct\n* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn\'t asked for\n* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect\n\nFinally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you\'re just reviewing one file, `/routes/authRoutes.js`. You don\'t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.\n\nNote that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that\'s not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don\'t ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it\'s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important.

Do not reply with anything else but the command with which I can run this app with.
For example, if the command is "python app.py", then your response needs to be only `python app.py` without the `

Pay attention to file paths: if the command or argument is a file or folder from the project, use paths relative to the project root (for example, use `./somefile` instead of `/somefile`).

If there is no command to run reply with empty response.

How can a human user test if this task was completed successfully?

Please list actions, step by step, in order, that the user should take to verify the task. After each action, describe what the expected response is.

**IMPORTANT**

Follow these important rules when compiling a list of actions the user will take:

1. Actions must be as specific as possible. You don't want the user to have to think anything through but rather that they just follow your instructions.
2. In case this task can be tested by making an API request, you should always prefer to test functionality in the browser. In case you can't do that, do not suggest how can a request be made with Postman but rather write a full cURL command that the user can just run.
3. Do not require the user to write any code or edit files to test this task.
4. If the user must run a command, assume the user already has a terminal opened in the project root directory (no need to instruct the user "open the terminal" or "make sure you're in the project directory")
5. The user is using Linux, so the commands must run on that operating system
6. Assume system services, such as the database, are already set up and running. Don't ask user to install or run any software other than the app they're testing.
7. Don't ask the user to test things which aren't implemented yet (eg. opening a theoretical web page that doesn't exist yet, or clicking on a button that isn't implemented yet)

Remember, these rules are very important and you must follow them!

Here is an example output with a few user steps:
---example---
### Step 1
Action: Start the server using `npm start`
Expected result: You should see the message "Connected to database" or similar

### Step 2
Action: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000/
Expected result: Web page opens and you see a "Hello World" message with a contact form

### Step 3
Action: Click on the "Submit" button in the web form
Expected result: Form is submitted, page is reloaded and "Thank you" message is shown
---end_of_example---

If nothing needs to be tested for this task, instead of outputting the steps, just output a single word: DONE

### Step 1
Action: Start the server using `npm start`
Expected result: You should see the message "Server running at http://localhost:3000" indicating that the server has started successfully.

### Step 2
Action: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000/auth/register
Expected result: The registration page opens. You should see a form with fields for "Username", "Password", a "Select Role" dropdown with options "Doctor" and "Hospital", and input fields for "Specialty (Doctors only)" and "Localization (Doctors only)".

### Step 3
Action: Fill out the form with a username and password, select "Doctor" as the role, and fill in the "Specialty" and "Localization" fields. Click the "Register" button to submit the form.
Expected result: After submitting, the page should redirect you to the login page at http://localhost:3000/auth/login, indicating that the doctor registration was successful.

### Step 4
Action: Return to the registration page at http://localhost:3000/auth/register and fill out the form again, but this time select "Hospital" as the role. Leave the "Specialty" and "Localization" fields empty and click the "Register" button.
Expected result: After submitting, the page should redirect you to the login page, indicating that the hospital registration was successful, and no error was thrown for leaving the "Specialty" and "Localization" fields empty.

### Step 5
Action: Open the MongoDB management tool of your choice (e.g., MongoDB Compass) and connect to your database.
Expected result: In the `users` collection, you should see two new records: one with the role "doctor" including the "specialty" and "localization" fields filled, and another with the role "hospital" without "specialty" and "localization" fields.

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```
You are currently working on task "Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only." and you have to focus only on that task.

**IMPORTANT**
You have to review this task implementation. You are known to be very strict with your reviews and very good at noticing bugs but you don't mind minor changes like refactoring, adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.

Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.
In this review, your goal is to check:
1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.
2. If new files or functions are created but never called or used.
3. If there is some "dead code" that should be removed.
4. If there is some duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.

If everything is ok respond only with "DONE" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything is ok, respond just with "DONE".

If you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."
------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------

Here is description of app that you are working on:
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

User was given instructions on how to test if the app is working correctly. Here are the instructions:
```
Can you check if the app works please? Here is a description of what should be working: 

[36m[1m### Step 1
Action: Start the server using `npm start`
Expected result: You should see the message "Server running at http://localhost:3000" indicating that the server has started successfully.

### Step 2
Action: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000/auth/register
Expected result: The registration page opens. You should see a form with fields for "Username", "Password", a "Select Role" dropdown with options "Doctor" and "Hospital", and input fields for "Specialty (Doctors only)" and "Localization (Doctors only)".

### Step 3
Action: Fill out the form with a username and password, select "Doctor" as the role, and fill in the "Specialty" and "Localization" fields. Click the "Register" button to submit the form.
Expected result: After submitting, the page should redirect you to the login page at http://localhost:3000/auth/login, indicating that the doctor registration was successful.

### Step 4
Action: Return to the registration page at http://localhost:3000/auth/register and fill out the form again, but this time select "Hospital" as the role. Leave the "Specialty" and "Localization" fields empty and click the "Register" button.
Expected result: After submitting, the page should redirect you to the login page, indicating that the hospital registration was successful, and no error was thrown for leaving the "Specialty" and "Localization" fields empty.

### Step 5
Action: Open the MongoDB management tool of your choice (e.g., MongoDB Compass) and connect to your database.
Expected result: In the `users` collection, you should see two new records: one with the role "doctor" including the "specialty" and "localization" fields filled, and another with the role "hospital" without "specialty" and "localization" fields.[0m
[33m[1m

If you want to run the app, just type "r" and press ENTER and that will run `npm start`[0m
```


User wrote this feedback:
```
In step 5 hospital has specialty and localization, but that's OK for now
```


Your job is to identify if feedback is good enough for you to solve the problem. If not, what information you need to solve the problem. Ask for any information that you need to solve the problem.

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

```

Project architecture:
The Giełda_dyżurowa application will follow a traditional three-tier web application architecture, consisting of a presentation layer (frontend), an application layer (backend), and a data layer (database). The frontend will be built using EJS for templating, Bootstrap for CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for interactions, providing a responsive user interface for both doctors and hospitals to interact with. The backend will be developed using Node.js and the Express framework, handling all business logic, including user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties. MongoDB, coupled with Mongoose ORM, will be used as the database to store and manage user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts efficiently.

Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

* Node.js - JavaScript runtime for building apps. This is required to be able to run the app you're building.
* MongoDB - NoSQL database. If you don't want to install MongoDB locally, you can use a cloud version such as MongoDB Atlas.
* express - Express web server for Node
* mongoose - Mongoose ORM for MongoDB
* bcrypt - Library for hashing passwords
* express-session - Middleware for session management in Express
* dotenv - Module to load environment variables from a .env file
* ejs - Templating engine for rendering views


Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```
You are currently working on task "Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only." and you have to focus only on that task.

User who was using the app "Giełda_dyżurowa" sent you this feedback:
```
In step 5 hospital has specialty and localization, but that's OK for now
```


Now, you have to debug this issue and comply with the additional user feedback.

**IMPORTANT**
Think about all information provided. Your job is to look at big picture by analysing all files to find where the issue is.
Don't reply with any code, your thoughts or breakdown of the issue. Respond only with description of solution, explaining what should be steps in solving the issue.
Create as little steps as possible to fix the issue. Each step should describe, using sentences and not code, what changes are needed in specific file or describe command that needs to be executed to continue working on the issue.
When there are multiple things that have to be done in one file write everything as one step and don't split it in multiple steps.
You can count that the environment is set up previously and packages listed in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation of new dependencies, if there are any.

**IMPORTANT**
If report mentions *multiple* issues, treat it as if you got several separate reports: think through each, and provide solutions for each.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file.

2024-03-22 06:57:20,887 [llm_connection.py:540 - stream_gpt_completion() ] INFO: <<<<<<<<<< LLM Response <<<<<<<<<<
To address the user feedback regarding the unnecessary fields for hospitals (specialty and localization) during registration and ensure compliance with the application's requirements, the following steps should be taken:

1. Modify the `models/User.js` file to make the `specialty` and `localization` fields conditional based on the user's role. This involves updating the `userSchema.pre('validate')` middleware function to check if the role is 'doctor' before enforcing the requirement for the `specialty` and `localization` fields. Additionally, adjust the schema to not strictly require these fields for all users.

2. Update the `views/register.ejs` file to conditionally display the input fields for `specialty` and `localization` based on the selected role. This can be achieved by adding a JavaScript function that listens for changes to the role selection dropdown and toggles the visibility of the `specialty` and `localization` input fields accordingly. Ensure to include a script tag at the end of the file for this JavaScript code.

3. Adjust the `routes/authRoutes.js` file in the POST handler for '/auth/register' to conditionally include `specialty` and `localization` in the user creation process based on the role. Specifically, only include these fields in the object passed to `User.create()` if the selected role is 'doctor'. This ensures that hospitals do not have unnecessary fields in their documents.

To address the user feedback regarding the unnecessary fields for hospitals (specialty and localization) during registration and ensure compliance with the application's requirements, the following steps should be taken:

1. Modify the `models/User.js` file to make the `specialty` and `localization` fields conditional based on the user's role. This involves updating the `userSchema.pre('validate')` middleware function to check if the role is 'doctor' before enforcing the requirement for the `specialty` and `localization` fields. Additionally, adjust the schema to not strictly require these fields for all users.

2. Update the `views/register.ejs` file to conditionally display the input fields for `specialty` and `localization` based on the selected role. This can be achieved by adding a JavaScript function that listens for changes to the role selection dropdown and toggles the visibility of the `specialty` and `localization` input fields accordingly. Ensure to include a script tag at the end of the file for this JavaScript code.

3. Adjust the `routes/authRoutes.js` file in the POST handler for '/auth/register' to conditionally include `specialty` and `localization` in the user creation process based on the role. Specifically, only include these fields in the object passed to `User.create()` if the selected role is 'doctor'. This ensures that hospitals do not have unnecessary fields in their documents.

Ok, now, take your previous message that starts with `To address the user feedback` and ends with `unnecessary fields in their documents.` and convert it to a list of actionable steps that will be executed by a machine. Analyze the entire message, think step by step and make sure that you don't omit any information when converting this message to steps.

Each step can be either:

* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a Linux machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)
* `save_file` - create or update ONE file
* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done. Also you MUST NOT use `human_intervention` to ask the human to write or review code.

**IMPORTANT**: In `code_change_description` field of `save_file` step, you must provide empty string. If multiple changes are required for same file, you must provide single `save_file` step for each file.

When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember, NEVER output human intervention steps to do manual tests or coding tasks, even if the previous message asks for it! The testing will be done *after* these steps and you MUST NOT include testing in these steps.

      console.error('Error hashing password:', err);
      return next(err);
    }
    user.password = hash;

    const err = new Error('Specialty and Localization are required for doctors.');
    console.error('Validation error:', err);
    next(err);
  } else {
    next();
  }
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

module.exports = User;
```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/models/User.js`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  role: { type: String, required: true, enum: ['doctor', 'hospital'] },
  specialty: { type: String },
  localization: { type: String }
});

userSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  const user = this;
  if (!user.isModified('password')) return next();
  bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10, (err, hash) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error hashing password:', err);
      return next(err);
    }
    user.password = hash;
    next();
  });
});

userSchema.pre('validate', function(next) {
  if (this.role === 'doctor' && (!this.specialty || !this.localization)) {
    const err = new Error('Specialty and Localization are required for doctors.');
    console.error('Validation error:', err);
    next(err);
  } else {
    next();
  }
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

module.exports = User;
```

Here is the diff of the changes:

## Hunk 1
```diff

   password: { type: String, required: true },

   } else {

   }
```


As you can see, there are 2 hunks in this diff, and each starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/models/User.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

However, this is not an ideal approach because the schema validation should prevent these fields from being required or set for hospitals in the first place. Additionally, manipulating data in a 'pre-validate' hook to unset fields could lead to unintended side effects and is not a common practice. A better solution would involve proper validation logic that conditionally requires fields based on the role without modifying the data.",

    ],
    "review_notes": "The developer's approach to handling conditional fields based on user roles shows an understanding of the requirements, but the implementation in the second hunk could be improved by focusing on validation rather than manipulating data. It's important to ensure that the schema design and validation logic align with the application's functional requirements without introducing unnecessary complexity or potential data integrity issues."

For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:\n* applied - if the change is correct\n* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn\'t asked for\n* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect\n\nFinally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that.

You don\'t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.\n\nNote that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that\'s not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don\'t ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it\'s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important.

Reviewer feedback:
This hunk attempts to handle the scenario where a hospital might inadvertently have 'specialty' or 'localization' fields set by unsetting these fields if the role is 'hospital'. However, this is not an ideal approach because the schema validation should prevent these fields from being required or set for hospitals in the first place. Additionally, manipulating data in a 'pre-validate' hook to unset fields could lead to unintended side effects and is not a common practice. A better solution would involve proper validation logic that conditionally requires fields based on the role without modifying the data.

Review notes:
The developer's approach to handling conditional fields based on user roles shows an understanding of the requirements, but the implementation in the second hunk could be improved by focusing on validation rather than manipulating data. It's important to ensure that the schema design and validation logic align with the application's functional requirements without introducing unnecessary complexity or potential data integrity issues.

>>>>>>>>>> User Prompt >>>>>>>>>>
A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/models/User.js`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  role: { type: String, required: true, enum: ['doctor', 'hospital'] },
  specialty: { type: String },
  localization: { type: String }
});

userSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  const user = this;
  if (!user.isModified('password')) return next();
  bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10, (err, hash) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error hashing password:', err);
      return next(err);
    }
    user.password = hash;
    next();
  });
});

userSchema.pre('validate', function(next) {
  if (this.role === 'doctor' && (!this.specialty || !this.localization)) {
    const err = new Error('Specialty and Localization are required for doctors.');
    console.error('Validation error:', err);
    next(err);
  } else {
    next();
  }
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

module.exports = User;
```

Here is the diff of the changes:

## Hunk 1
```diff
@@ -5,8 +5,8 @@
   username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
   password: { type: String, required: true },
   role: { type: String, required: true, enum: ['doctor', 'hospital'] },
-  specialty: { type: String },
-  localization: { type: String }
+  specialty: { type: String, required: false },
+  localization: { type: String, required: false }
 });
 
 userSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
```


As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/models/User.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you\'re saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn\'t support comments (eg JSON), don\'t add any.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Logging\nWhenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn\'t contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Error handling\nWhenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn\'t be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn\'t contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang="en">\n<%- include(\'partials/_head.ejs\') %>\n  <body>\n<%- include(\'partials/_header.ejs\') %>\n    <main role="main">\n      <div class="container mt-5">\n        <h2>Register</h2>\n        <form action="/auth/register" method="POST">\n          <div class="mb-3">\n            <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" required class="form-control">\n          </div>\n          <div class="mb-3">\n            <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required class="form-control">\n          </div>\n          <div class="mb-3">\n            <select name="role" required class="form-control" id="roleSelect">\n              <option value="">Select Role</option>\n              <option value="doctor">Doctor</option>\n              <option value="hospital">Hospital</option>\n            </select>\n          </div>\n          <div class="mb-3" id="specialtyInput" style="display:none;">\n            <input type="text" name="specialty" placeholder="Specialty (Doctors only)" class="form-control">\n          </div>\n          <div class="mb-3" id="localizationInput" style="display:none;">\n            <input type="text" name="localization" placeholder="Localization (Doctors only)" class="form-control">\n          </div>\n          <div class="mb-3">\n            <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary mr-2">Register</button>\n            Already have an account? <a href="/auth/login">Login</a>\n          </div>\n        </form>\n      </div>\n    </main>\n    <script>\n      document.getElementById(\'roleSelect\').addEventListener(\'change\', function() {\n        var display = this.value === \'doctor\' ? \'block\' : \'none\';\n        document.getElementById(\'specialtyInput\').style.display = display;\n        document.getElementById(\'localizationInput\').style.display = display;\n      });\n    </script>\n  </body>\n<%- include(\'partials/_footer.ejs\') %>\n</html>\n```'}]

As you can see, there are 2 hunks in this diff, and each starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/views/register.ejs`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

Here is the diff of the changes:

     }

     console.log(`New user registered: ${user.username}, Role: ${user.role}`);
     res.redirect('/auth/login');
   } catch (error) {
```


As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/routes/authRoutes.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

```

Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```
You are currently working on task "Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only." and you have to focus only on that task.

While working on this task, your colleague who is testing the app "Giełda_dyżurowa" sent you some additional info. Here it is:
```
In step 5 hospital has specialty and localization, but that's OK for now
```

After this info, you tried to fix it. Files that were modified during implementation of the task are:
```
['/models/User.js', '/views/register.ejs', '/routes/authRoutes.js']
```

Now I will show you how those files looked before this task implementation started. If a file is listed as the file that changed but is not in this list that means it was created during this task. Here are files before implementation of this task:

**IMPORTANT**
You have to review this task implementation. You are known to be very strict with your reviews and very good at noticing bugs but you don't mind minor changes like refactoring, adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.

Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.
In this review, your goal is to check:
1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.
2. If new files or functions are created but never called or used.
3. If there is some "dead code" that should be removed.
4. If there is some duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.

If everything is ok respond only with "DONE" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything is ok, respond just with "DONE".

If you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."
------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```
You are currently working on task "Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only." and you have to focus only on that task.

A part of the app is already finished.
Here are files that were modified during this task implementation:

---end_of_current_files---
While working on this task, your colleague who is testing the app "Giełda_dyżurowa" sent you some additional info. Here it is:
```
In step 5 hospital has specialty and localization, but that's OK for now
```

After this info, you tried to fix it. Files that were modified during implementation of the task are:
```
['/models/User.js', '/views/register.ejs', '/routes/authRoutes.js']
```

Now I will show you how those files looked before this task implementation started. If a file is listed as the file that changed but is not in this list that means it was created during this task. Here are files before implementation of this task:

**IMPORTANT**
You have to review this task implementation. You are known to be very strict with your reviews and very good at noticing bugs but you don't mind minor changes like refactoring, adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.

Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.
In this review, your goal is to check:
1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.
2. If new files or functions are created but never called or used.
3. If there is some "dead code" that should be removed.
4. If there is some duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.

If everything is ok respond only with "DONE" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything is ok, respond just with "DONE".

If you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."

The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Here is a short description of the project architecture:
The Giełda_dyżurowa application will follow a traditional three-tier web application architecture, consisting of a presentation layer (frontend), an application layer (backend), and a data layer (database). The frontend will be built using EJS for templating, Bootstrap for CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for interactions, providing a responsive user interface for both doctors and hospitals to interact with. The backend will be developed using Node.js and the Express framework, handling all business logic, including user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties. MongoDB, coupled with Mongoose ORM, will be used as the database to store and manage user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts efficiently.

Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

* Node.js - JavaScript runtime for building apps. This is required to be able to run the app you're building.
* MongoDB - NoSQL database. If you don't want to install MongoDB locally, you can use a cloud version such as MongoDB Atlas.
* express - Express web server for Node
* mongoose - Mongoose ORM for MongoDB
* bcrypt - Library for hashing passwords
* express-session - Middleware for session management in Express
* dotenv - Module to load environment variables from a .env file
* ejs - Templating engine for rendering views



Here are files that are currently implemented:

---END_OF_FILES---


We've broken the development of this app down to these tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```

You are currently working on task #2 with the following description:
```
Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.
```
All previous tasks are finished and you don't have to work on them.

Now, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands that need to be run to implement this task.

**IMPORTANT**
Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.

DO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written. When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."
------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**
When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file.

Never use the port 5000 to run the app, it's reserved.

To implement task #2, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

No new dependencies are needed for this task since all required packages are already included in the project setup.

### Step 2: Create the Duty Slot Model

**File: models/DutySlot.js**
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const dutySlotSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  date: { type: Date, required: true },
  dutyHours: { type: String, required: true },
  requiredSpecialty: { type: String, required: true },
  hospitalId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true }
});

const DutySlot = mongoose.model('DutySlot', dutySlotSchema);

module.exports = DutySlot;
```

### Step 3: Create the Duty Slot Publication View

**File: views/dutyPublish.ejs**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<%- include('partials/_head.ejs') %>
  <body>
<%- include('partials/_header.ejs') %>
    <main class="container mt-5">
      <h2>Publish Duty Slot</h2>
      <form action="/duty/publish" method="POST">
        <div class="mb-3">
          <label for="date" class="form-label">Date</label>
          <input type="date" name="date" required class="form-control" id="date">
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          <label for="dutyHours" class="form-label">Duty Hours</label>
          <input type="text" name="dutyHours" placeholder="e.g., 20:00 - 08:00" required class="form-control" id="dutyHours">
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          <label for="requiredSpecialty" class="form-label">Required Specialty</label>
          <input type="text" name="requiredSpecialty" required class="form-control" id="requiredSpecialty">
        </div>
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Publish</button>
      </form>
    </main>
  </body>
<%- include('partials/_footer.ejs') %>
</html>
```

### Step 4: Update the Routes to Include Duty Slot Publication

**File: routes/dutyRoutes.js**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const DutySlot = require('../models/DutySlot');
const { isAuthenticated } = require('./middleware/authMiddleware');

const router = express.Router();

// Middleware to ensure only hospitals can access certain routes
const isHospital = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.session.role === 'hospital') {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(403).send('Access denied. Only hospitals can perform this action.');
  }
};

router.get('/duty/publish', isAuthenticated, isHospital, (req, res) => {
  res.render('dutyPublish');
});

router.post('/duty/publish', isAuthenticated, isHospital, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { date, dutyHours, requiredSpecialty } = req.body;
    const hospitalId = req.session.userId; // Assuming session stores userId
    const newDutySlot = await DutySlot.create({
      date,
      dutyHours,
      requiredSpecialty,
      hospitalId,
    });
    console.log(`New duty slot created: ${newDutySlot}`);
    res.redirect('/'); // Redirect to a confirmation page or back to the form
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating duty slot:', error);
    res.status(500).send(error.message);
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

### Step 5: Update the Main Server File to Use the New Route

**File: server.js**
```javascript
// After other require statements
const dutyRoutes = require('./routes/dutyRoutes');

// After other app.use() middleware
app.use(dutyRoutes);
```

### Step 6: Update the Authentication Middleware to Store User Role in Session

**File: routes/authRoutes.js**
- In the `router.post('/auth/login'...` route, after successfully validating the user, add the user's role to the session:
```javascript
req.session.role = user.role;
```

This addition will help in enforcing role-based access control in the `dutyRoutes.js` file as implemented above.

  hospitalId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true }
});

const DutySlot = mongoose.model('DutySlot', dutySlotSchema);

module.exports = DutySlot;
```

### Step 3: Create the Duty Slot Publication View

**File: views/dutyPublish.ejs**
```html

### Step 4: Update the Routes to Include Duty Slot Publication

**File: routes/dutyRoutes.js**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const DutySlot = require('../models/DutySlot');
const { isAuthenticated } = require('./middleware/authMiddleware');

const router = express.Router();

// Middleware to ensure only hospitals can access certain routes
const isHospital = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.session.role === 'hospital') {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(403).send('Access denied. Only hospitals can perform this action.');
  }
};

router.get('/duty/publish', isAuthenticated, isHospital, (req, res) => {
  res.render('dutyPublish');
});

router.post('/duty/publish', isAuthenticated, isHospital, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { date, dutyHours, requiredSpecialty } = req.body;
    const hospitalId = req.session.userId; // Assuming session stores userId
    const newDutySlot = await DutySlot.create({
      date,
      dutyHours,
      requiredSpecialty,
      hospitalId,
    });
    console.log(`New duty slot created: ${newDutySlot}`);

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating duty slot:', error);
    res.status(500).send(error.message);
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

### Step 5: Update the Main Server File to Use the New Route

**File: server.js**
```javascript
// After other require statements
const dutyRoutes = require('./routes/dutyRoutes');

// After other app.use() middleware
app.use(dutyRoutes);
```

### Step 6: Update the Authentication Middleware to Store User Role in Session

**File: routes/authRoutes.js**
- In the `router.post('/auth/login'...` route, after successfully validating the user, add the user's role to the session:
```javascript
req.session.role = user.role;
```

This addition will help in enforcing role-based access control in the `dutyRoutes.js` file as implemented above.

>>>>>>>>>> User Prompt >>>>>>>>>>
Ok, now, take your previous message that starts with `To implement task #2, you'll` and ends with ``dutyRoutes.js` file as implemented above.` and convert it to a list of actionable steps that will be executed by a machine. Analyze the entire message, think step by step and make sure that you don't omit any information when converting this message to steps.

Each step can be either:

* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a Linux machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)
* `save_file` - create or update ONE file
* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done. Also you MUST NOT use `human_intervention` to ask the human to write or review code.

**IMPORTANT**: In `code_change_description` field of `save_file` step, you must provide empty string. If multiple changes are required for same file, you must provide single `save_file` step for each file.

When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember, NEVER output human intervention steps to do manual tests or coding tasks, even if the previous message asks for it! The testing will be done *after* these steps and you MUST NOT include testing in these steps.

Analyze the entire message, think step by step and make sure that you don\'t omit any information when converting this message to steps.\n\nEach step can be either:\n\n* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a Linux machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)\n* `save_file` - create or update ONE file\n* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done. Also you MUST NOT use `human_intervention` to ask the human to write or review code.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: In `code_change_description` field of `save_file` step, you must provide empty string. If multiple changes are required for same file, you must provide single `save_file` step for each file.\n\nWhen creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.\n\nAll the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Remember, NEVER output human intervention steps to do manual tests or coding tasks, even if the previous message asks for it!

I need to modify file `/models/DutySlot.js` that currently looks like this:
```

```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/models/DutySlot.js`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```

```

Here is the diff of the changes:

```diff

+const mongoose = require('mongoose');

```


As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/models/DutySlot.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

I need to modify file `/views/dutyPublish.ejs` that currently looks like this:
```

```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/views/dutyPublish.ejs`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:\n* applied - if the change is correct\n* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn\'t asked for\n* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect\n\nFinally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you\'re just reviewing one file, `/views/dutyPublish.ejs`. You don\'t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.\n\nNote that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that\'s not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don\'t ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it\'s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 2,\n            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 3,\n            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",\n            "decision": "ignore"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 4,\n            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",\n            "decision": "rework"\n        },\n    ],\n    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{"hunks": [{"number": 1, "reason": "The changes correctly implement the form for hospitals to publish new duty slots as instructed, including fields for date, duty hours, and required specialty.

I need to modify file `/routes/dutyRoutes.js` that currently looks like this:
```

```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/routes/dutyRoutes.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

As you can see, there are 3 hunks in this diff, and each starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/server.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/routes/authRoutes.js`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```
const express = require('express');
const User = require('../models/User');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/auth/register', (req, res) => {
  res.render('register');
});

router.post('/auth/register', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { username, password, role, specialty, localization } = req.body;
    // Validate specialty and localization for doctors
    if(role === 'doctor' && (!specialty || !localization)) {
      throw new Error('Specialty and Localization are required for doctors.');
    }
    // Conditionally include specialty and localization based on role
    const userData = { username, password, role };
    if(role === 'doctor') {
      userData.specialty = specialty;
      userData.localization = localization;
    }
    const user = await User.create(userData);
    console.log(`New user registered: ${user.username}, Role: ${user.role}`);
    res.redirect('/auth/login');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Registration error:', error);
    console.error(error.stack); // Log the error stack for more detailed debugging information
    res.status(500).send(error.message);
  }
});

router.get('/auth/login', (req, res) => {
  res.render('login');
});

router.post('/auth/login', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { username, password } = req.body;
    const user = await User.findOne({ username });
    if (!user) {
      console.log('Login attempt: User not found');
      return res.status(400).send('User not found');
    }
    const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
    if (isMatch) {
      req.session.userId = user._id;
      console.log(`User logged in: ${user.username}`);
      return res.redirect('/');
    } else {
      console.log(`Login attempt failed for user: ${username}`);
      return res.status(400).send('Password is incorrect');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Login error:', error);
    console.error(error.stack); // Log the error stack for more detailed debugging information
    return res.status(500).send(error.message);
  }
});

router.get('/auth/logout', (req, res) => {
  req.session.destroy(err => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error during session destruction:', err);
      console.error(err.stack); // Log the error stack for more detailed debugging information
      return res.status(500).send('Error logging out');
    }
    console.log('User logged out successfully');
    res.redirect('/auth/login');
  });
});

module.exports = router;
```

Here is the diff of the changes:

## Hunk 1
```diff
@@ -45,6 +45,7 @@
     const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
     if (isMatch) {
       req.session.userId = user._id;
+      req.session.role = user.role; // Store user role in session for role-based access control
       console.log(`User logged in: ${user.username}`);
       return res.redirect('/');
     } else {
```


As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/routes/authRoutes.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

How can I run this app?
**IMPORTANT**
Do not reply with anything else but the command with which I can run this app with.
For example, if the command is "python app.py", then your response needs to be only `python app.py` without the `

Pay attention to file paths: if the command or argument is a file or folder from the project, use paths relative to the project root (for example, use `./somefile` instead of `/somefile`).

If there is no command to run reply with empty response.
For example, if we only setup package.json and no other files are coded there is no command to run so respond with `` without the `

How can a human user test if this task was completed successfully?

Please list actions, step by step, in order, that the user should take to verify the task. After each action, describe what the expected response is.

**IMPORTANT**

Follow these important rules when compiling a list of actions the user will take:

1. Actions must be as specific as possible. You don't want the user to have to think anything through but rather that they just follow your instructions.
2. In case this task can be tested by making an API request, you should always prefer to test functionality in the browser. In case you can't do that, do not suggest how can a request be made with Postman but rather write a full cURL command that the user can just run.
3. Do not require the user to write any code or edit files to test this task.
4. If the user must run a command, assume the user already has a terminal opened in the project root directory (no need to instruct the user "open the terminal" or "make sure you're in the project directory")
5. The user is using Linux, so the commands must run on that operating system
6. Assume system services, such as the database, are already set up and running. Don't ask user to install or run any software other than the app they're testing.
7. Don't ask the user to test things which aren't implemented yet (eg. opening a theoretical web page that doesn't exist yet, or clicking on a button that isn't implemented yet)

Remember, these rules are very important and you must follow them!

Here is an example output with a few user steps:
---example---
### Step 1
Action: Start the server using `npm start`
Expected result: You should see the message "Connected to database" or similar

### Step 2
Action: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000/
Expected result: Web page opens and you see a "Hello World" message with a contact form

### Step 3
Action: Click on the "Submit" button in the web form
Expected result: Form is submitted, page is reloaded and "Thank you" message is shown
---end_of_example---

If nothing needs to be tested for this task, instead of outputting the steps, just output a single word: DONE

2024-03-22 07:09:47,857 [llm_connection.py:540 - stream_gpt_completion() ] INFO: <<<<<<<<<< LLM Response <<<<<<<<<<
### Step 1
Action: Start the server using `npm start`.
Expected result: You should see the message "Server running at http://localhost:3000" in your terminal, indicating the server has started successfully.

### Step 2
Action: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/auth/register.
Expected result: You should see a registration form for creating new accounts. This indicates the server is running and serving pages.

### Step 3
Action: Fill out the registration form with details for a hospital account (make sure to select "Hospital" as the role) and click the "Register" button.
Expected result: You should be redirected to the login page at http://localhost:3000/auth/login, indicating the hospital account was successfully created.

### Step 4
Action: Log in with the hospital account you just created by entering the username and password on the login page and clicking the "Login" button.
Expected result: After a successful login, you should be redirected to the homepage. This confirms that hospital accounts can log in.

### Step 5
Action: In the web browser's address bar, navigate to http://localhost:3000/duty/publish.
Expected result: You should see a form for publishing a new duty slot, indicating that the duty slot publication page is accessible by hospitals.

### Step 6
Action: Fill out the form with a date, duty hours (e.g., "20:00 - 08:00"), and a required specialty for the duty slot, then click the "Publish" button.
Expected result: You should be redirected back to the homepage, and in the terminal where the server is running, you should see a log indicating a new duty slot was created, e.g., "New duty slot created: [details of the duty slot]". This confirms that hospitals can publish new duty slots successfully.

### Step 7
Action: Try to access the duty slot publication page (http://localhost:3000/duty/publish) from a non-hospital account or without being logged in.
Expected result: You should receive a message stating "Access denied. Only hospitals can perform this action." or be redirected to the login page, indicating that the publication feature is restricted to users with the 'hospital' role.

Expected result: You should see the message "Server running at http://localhost:3000" in your terminal, indicating the server has started successfully.

### Step 2
Action: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/auth/register.
Expected result: You should see a registration form for creating new accounts. This indicates the server is running and serving pages.

### Step 3
Action: Fill out the registration form with details for a hospital account (make sure to select "Hospital" as the role) and click the "Register" button.
Expected result: You should be redirected to the login page at http://localhost:3000/auth/login, indicating the hospital account was successfully created.

### Step 4
Action: Log in with the hospital account you just created by entering the username and password on the login page and clicking the "Login" button.
Expected result: After a successful login, you should be redirected to the homepage. This confirms that hospital accounts can log in.

### Step 5
Action: In the web browser's address bar, navigate to http://localhost:3000/duty/publish.
Expected result: You should see a form for publishing a new duty slot, indicating that the duty slot publication page is accessible by hospitals.

### Step 6
Action: Fill out the form with a date, duty hours (e.g., "20:00 - 08:00"), and a required specialty for the duty slot, then click the "Publish" button.
Expected result: You should be redirected back to the homepage, and in the terminal where the server is running, you should see a log indicating a new duty slot was created, e.g., "New duty slot created: [details of the duty slot]". This confirms that hospitals can publish new duty slots successfully.

### Step 7
Action: Try to access the duty slot publication page (http://localhost:3000/duty/publish) from a non-hospital account or without being logged in.
Expected result: You should receive a message stating "Access denied. Only hospitals can perform this action." or be redirected to the login page, indicating that the publication feature is restricted to users with the 'hospital' role.

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

```

Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```
You are currently working on task "Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details." and you have to focus only on that task.

A part of the app is already finished.

**IMPORTANT**
You have to review this task implementation. You are known to be very strict with your reviews and very good at noticing bugs but you don't mind minor changes like refactoring, adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.

Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.
In this review, your goal is to check:
1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.
2. If new files or functions are created but never called or used.
3. If there is some "dead code" that should be removed.
4. If there is some duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.

If everything is ok respond only with "DONE" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything is ok, respond just with "DONE".

If you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."
------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------

Think about this output and not any output in previous messages. If the command was successfully executed, respond with `DONE`. If it wasn't, respond with `BUG`.

Do not respond with anything other than these two keywords.

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```
You are currently working on task "Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details." and you have to focus only on that task.

**IMPORTANT**
You have to review this task implementation. You are known to be very strict with your reviews and very good at noticing bugs but you don't mind minor changes like refactoring, adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.

Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.
In this review, your goal is to check:
1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.
2. If new files or functions are created but never called or used.
3. If there is some "dead code" that should be removed.
4. If there is some duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.

If everything is ok respond only with "DONE" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything is ok, respond just with "DONE".

If you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for "Giełda_dyżurowa" as well.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

```

Here is a short description of the project architecture:
The Giełda_dyżurowa application will follow a traditional three-tier web application architecture, consisting of a presentation layer (frontend), an application layer (backend), and a data layer (database). The frontend will be built using EJS for templating, Bootstrap for CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for interactions, providing a responsive user interface for both doctors and hospitals to interact with. The backend will be developed using Node.js and the Express framework, handling all business logic, including user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties. MongoDB, coupled with Mongoose ORM, will be used as the database to store and manage user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts efficiently.

Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

* Node.js - JavaScript runtime for building apps. This is required to be able to run the app you're building.
* MongoDB - NoSQL database. If you don't want to install MongoDB locally, you can use a cloud version such as MongoDB Atlas.
* express - Express web server for Node

---END_OF_FILES---


We've broken the development of this app down to these tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```

You are currently working on task #3 with the following description:
```
Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.
```
All previous tasks are finished and you don't have to work on them.

Now, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands that need to be run to implement this task.

**IMPORTANT**
Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.

DO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written. When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."

When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file.

Never use the port 5000 to run the app, it's reserved.

To implement the functionality for doctors to post their availability, you'll need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create the DoctorAvailability Model

**File: models/DoctorAvailability.js**
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const doctorAvailabilitySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  doctorId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  date: { type: Date, required: true },
  availableHours: { type: String, required: true },
});

const DoctorAvailability = mongoose.model('DoctorAvailability', doctorAvailabilitySchema);

module.exports = DoctorAvailability;
```

### Step 2: Add Route to Handle Doctor's Availability Posting

**File: routes/doctorAvailabilityRoutes.js**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const DoctorAvailability = require('../models/DoctorAvailability');
const { isAuthenticated } = require('./middleware/authMiddleware');

const router = express.Router();

// Middleware to ensure only doctors can access certain routes
const isDoctor = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.session.role === 'doctor') {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(403).send('Access denied. Only doctors can perform this action.');
  }
};

router.get('/doctor/availability', isAuthenticated, isDoctor, (req, res) => {
  res.render('doctorAvailability');
});

router.post('/doctor/availability', isAuthenticated, isDoctor, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { date, availableHours } = req.body;
    const doctorId = req.session.userId; // Assuming session stores userId
    await DoctorAvailability.create({
      doctorId,
      date,
      availableHours,
    });
    console.log('Availability posted successfully.');
    res.redirect('/'); // Redirect to a confirmation page or back to the form
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error posting availability:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Error while posting availability. Please try again later.');
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

### Step 3: Create the EJS View for Doctor's Availability Posting

**File: views/doctorAvailability.ejs**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<%- include('partials/_head.ejs') %>
  <body>
<%- include('partials/_header.ejs') %>
    <main class="container mt-5">
      <h2>Post Your Availability</h2>
      <form action="/doctor/availability" method="POST">
        <div class="mb-3">
          <label for="date" class="form-label">Date</label>
          <input type="date" name="date" required class="form-control" id="date">
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          <label for="availableHours" class="form-label">Available Hours</label>
          <input type="text" name="availableHours" placeholder="e.g., 18:00 - 06:00" required class="form-control" id="availableHours">
        </div>
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Post Availability</button>
      </form>
    </main>
  </body>
<%- include('partials/_footer.ejs') %>
</html>
```

### Step 4: Update server.js to Use the New Route

**File: server.js**
- In the existing `server.js` file, you'll need to require and use the new route. Add the following lines:

```javascript
const doctorAvailabilityRoutes = require('./routes/doctorAvailabilityRoutes');
// Use Doctor Availability Routes
app.use(doctorAvailabilityRoutes);
```

- Place these lines after the other routes are set up with `app.use()`.

### Step 5: Install Any New Dependencies

Since all required dependencies are already included in your project setup, no additional installation commands are needed.

By following these steps, you will have implemented the functionality for doctors to post their availability.

>>>>>>>>>> User Prompt >>>>>>>>>>
Ok, now, take your previous message that starts with `To implement the functionality for` and ends with `doctors to post their availability.` and convert it to a list of actionable steps that will be executed by a machine. Analyze the entire message, think step by step and make sure that you don't omit any information when converting this message to steps.

Each step can be either:

* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a Linux machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)
* `save_file` - create or update ONE file
* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done. Also you MUST NOT use `human_intervention` to ask the human to write or review code.

**IMPORTANT**: In `code_change_description` field of `save_file` step, you must provide empty string. If multiple changes are required for same file, you must provide single `save_file` step for each file.

When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember, NEVER output human intervention steps to do manual tests or coding tasks, even if the previous message asks for it! The testing will be done *after* these steps and you MUST NOT include testing in these steps.

Analyze the entire message, think step by step and make sure that you don\'t omit any information when converting this message to steps.\n\nEach step can be either:\n\n* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a Linux machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)\n* `save_file` - create or update ONE file\n* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done. Also you MUST NOT use `human_intervention` to ask the human to write or review code.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: In `code_change_description` field of `save_file` step, you must provide empty string. If multiple changes are required for same file, you must provide single `save_file` step for each file.\n\nWhen creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.\n\nAll the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Remember, NEVER output human intervention steps to do manual tests or coding tasks, even if the previous message asks for it! The testing will be done *after* these steps and you MUST NOT include testing in these steps.\n\nExamples:\n------------------------example_1---------------------------\n```\n{\n  "tasks": [\n    {\n      "type": "save_file",\n      "save_file": {\n        "name": "server.js",\n        "path": "/server.js",\n        "code_change_description": "",\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      "type": "command",\n      "command": {\n        "command": "ls",\n        "timeout": "5000",\n        "success_message": "README.md",\n        "command_id": "check_existence_of_readme_file"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{"tasks": [{"type": "save_file", "save_file": {"name": "DoctorAvailability.js", "path": "/models/DoctorAvailability.js", "code_change_description": ""}}, {"type": "save_file", "save_file": {"name": "doctorAvailabilityRoutes.js", "path": "/routes/doctorAvailabilityRoutes.js", "code_change_description": ""}}, {"type": "save_file", "save_file": {"name": "doctorAvailability.ejs", "path": "/views/doctorAvailability.ejs", "code_change_description": ""}}, {"type": "save_file", "save_file": {"name": "server.js", "path": "/server.js", "code_change_description": ""}}]}'}]

I need to modify file `/models/DoctorAvailability.js` that currently looks like this:
```

```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/models/DoctorAvailability.js`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```

```

Here is the diff of the changes:

## Hunk 1
```diff
@@ -0,0 +1,22 @@
+const mongoose = require('mongoose');
+
+const doctorAvailabilitySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
+  doctorId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
+  date: { type: Date, required: true },
+  availableHours: { type: String, required: true },
+});
+
+doctorAvailabilitySchema.pre('save', function(next) {
+  const availability = this;
+  if (!availability.doctorId || !availability.date || !availability.availableHours) {
+    const err = new Error('All fields must be provided: doctorId, date, availableHours');
+    console.error('Error before saving doctor availability:', err);
+    next(err);
+  } else {
+    next();
+  }
+});
+
+const DoctorAvailability = mongoose.model('DoctorAvailability', doctorAvailabilitySchema);
+
+module.exports = DoctorAvailability;
```


As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/models/DoctorAvailability.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

I need to modify file `/routes/doctorAvailabilityRoutes.js` that currently looks like this:
```

```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/routes/doctorAvailabilityRoutes.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:\n* applied - if the change is correct\n* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn\'t asked for\n* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect\n\nFinally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you\'re just reviewing one file, `/routes/doctorAvailabilityRoutes.js`. You don\'t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.\n\nNote that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that\'s not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don\'t ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it\'s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 2,\n            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 3,\n            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",\n            "decision": "ignore"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 4,\n            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",\n            "decision": "rework"\n        },\n    ],\n    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted.

I need to modify file `/views/doctorAvailability.ejs` that currently looks like this:
```

```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/views/doctorAvailability.ejs`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```

Here is the diff of the changes:

```


As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/views/doctorAvailability.ejs`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 2,\n            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 3,\n            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",\n            "decision": "ignore"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 4,\n            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",\n            "decision": "rework"\n        },\n    ],\n    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{"hunks": [{"number": 1, "reason": "The changes correctly implement the form for doctors to post their availability, matching the task requirements.

// Middleware to parse request bodies
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());

// Setting the templating engine to EJS

// Serve static files

  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(`Database connection error: ${err.message}`);
    console.error(err.stack);

      `Session accessed again at: ${new Date().toISOString()}, Views: ${sess.views}, User ID: ${sess.userId || '(unauthenticated)'}`,
    );
  }
  next();

```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/server.js`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```
// Load environment variables
require("dotenv").config();
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const express = require("express");
const session = require("express-session");
const MongoStore = require('connect-mongo');
const authRoutes = require("./routes/authRoutes");

  console.error("Error: config environment variables not set. Please create/edit .env configuration file.");
  process.exit(-1);
}

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Middleware to parse request bodies
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());

// Setting the templating engine to EJS
app.set("view engine", "ejs");

// Serve static files
app.use(express.static("public"));

// Database connection
mongoose
  .connect(process.env.DATABASE_URL)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Database connected successfully");
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(`Database connection error: ${err.message}`);
    console.error(err.stack);
    process.exit(1);
  });

// Session configuration with connect-mongo

    secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: MongoStore.create({ mongoUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL }),
  }),
);

app.on("error", (error) => {
  console.error(`Server error: ${error.message}`);
  console.error(error.stack);
});

// Logging session creation and destruction
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const sess = req.session;
  // Make session available to all views
  res.locals.session = sess;
  if (!sess.views) {
    sess.views = 1;
    console.log("Session created at: ", new Date().toISOString());
  } else {
    sess.views++;
    console.log(
      `Session accessed again at: ${new Date().toISOString()}, Views: ${sess.views}, User ID: ${sess.userId || '(unauthenticated)'}`,
    );
  }
  next();
});

// Authentication Routes
app.use(authRoutes);

// Duty Routes
app.use(dutyRoutes);

// Root path response
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.render("index");
});

// If no routes handled the request, it's a 404
app.use((req, res, next) => {

});

app.listen(port, () => {

});

```

As you can see, there are 3 hunks in this diff, and each starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/server.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:\n* applied - if the change is correct\n* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn\'t asked for\n* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect\n\nFinally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you\'re just reviewing one file, `/server.js`. You don\'t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.\n\nNote that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that\'s not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don\'t ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it\'s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important.

Do not reply with anything else but the command with which I can run this app with.
For example, if the command is "python app.py", then your response needs to be only `python app.py` without the `

Pay attention to file paths: if the command or argument is a file or folder from the project, use paths relative to the project root (for example, use `./somefile` instead of `/somefile`).

If there is no command to run reply with empty response.

How can a human user test if this task was completed successfully?

Please list actions, step by step, in order, that the user should take to verify the task. After each action, describe what the expected response is.

**IMPORTANT**

Follow these important rules when compiling a list of actions the user will take:

1. Actions must be as specific as possible. You don't want the user to have to think anything through but rather that they just follow your instructions.
2. In case this task can be tested by making an API request, you should always prefer to test functionality in the browser. In case you can't do that, do not suggest how can a request be made with Postman but rather write a full cURL command that the user can just run.
3. Do not require the user to write any code or edit files to test this task.
4. If the user must run a command, assume the user already has a terminal opened in the project root directory (no need to instruct the user "open the terminal" or "make sure you're in the project directory")
5. The user is using Linux, so the commands must run on that operating system
6. Assume system services, such as the database, are already set up and running. Don't ask user to install or run any software other than the app they're testing.
7. Don't ask the user to test things which aren't implemented yet (eg. opening a theoretical web page that doesn't exist yet, or clicking on a button that isn't implemented yet)

Remember, these rules are very important and you must follow them!

Here is an example output with a few user steps:
---example---
### Step 1
Action: Start the server using `npm start`
Expected result: You should see the message "Connected to database" or similar

### Step 2
Action: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000/
Expected result: Web page opens and you see a "Hello World" message with a contact form

### Step 3
Action: Click on the "Submit" button in the web form
Expected result: Form is submitted, page is reloaded and "Thank you" message is shown
---end_of_example---

If nothing needs to be tested for this task, instead of outputting the steps, just output a single word: DONE

### Step 1
Action: Start the server using `npm start`.
Expected result: You should see the message "Server running at http://localhost:3000" indicating that the server has successfully started.

### Step 2
Action: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000/auth/register.
Expected result: You should see a registration form with fields for Username, Password, Role, Specialty (Doctors only), and Localization (Doctors only).

### Step 3
Action: Fill out the registration form with details for a doctor user. Make sure to select "Doctor" as the role. Fill in the Specialty and Localization fields that appear when "Doctor" is selected. Click the "Register" button.
Expected result: After clicking "Register", you should be redirected to the login page at http://localhost:3000/auth/login.

### Step 4
Action: Log in with the doctor account you just created by entering the username and password you registered with and clicking the "Login" button.
Expected result: You should be redirected to the homepage of the app with a message indicating successful login or simply seeing the homepage indicating you're logged in.

### Step 5
Action: Visit http://localhost:3000/doctor/availability in your web browser.
Expected result: You should see a form titled "Post Your Availability" with fields to enter a date and available hours.

### Step 6
Action: Fill in the date and available hours (e.g., "18:00 - 06:00") in the form, and click the "Post Availability" button.
Expected result: After clicking the button, you should be redirected to the homepage of the app. This indicates that the availability information was successfully posted.

### Step 7
Action: To verify that the information was saved to the database, you would need direct access to the MongoDB database which goes beyond the scope of these instructions. However, if no errors were encountered and you were redirected back to the homepage after posting availability, it is a strong indicator that the operation was successful.

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

```

Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```
You are currently working on task "Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours." and you have to focus only on that task.

A part of the app is already finished.

Files that were modified during implementation of the task are:

Now I will show you how those files looked before this task implementation started. If a file is listed as the file that changed but is not in this list that means it was created during this task. Here are files before implementation of this task:

**IMPORTANT**
You have to review this task implementation. You are known to be very strict with your reviews and very good at noticing bugs but you don't mind minor changes like refactoring, adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.

Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.
In this review, your goal is to check:
1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.
2. If new files or functions are created but never called or used.
3. If there is some "dead code" that should be removed.
4. If there is some duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.

If everything is ok respond only with "DONE" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything is ok, respond just with "DONE".

If you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."
------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------

Think about this output and not any output in previous messages. If the command was successfully executed, respond with `DONE`. If it wasn't, respond with `BUG`.

Do not respond with anything other than these two keywords.

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```
You are currently working on task "Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours." and you have to focus only on that task.

A part of the app is already finished.

**IMPORTANT**
You have to review this task implementation. You are known to be very strict with your reviews and very good at noticing bugs but you don't mind minor changes like refactoring, adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.

Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.
In this review, your goal is to check:
1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.
2. If new files or functions are created but never called or used.
3. If there is some "dead code" that should be removed.
4. If there is some duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.

If everything is ok respond only with "DONE" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything is ok, respond just with "DONE".

If you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."
------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------

Here is description of app that you are working on:
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

User was given instructions on how to test if the app is working correctly. Here are the instructions:
```
Can you check if the app works please? Here is a description of what should be working: 

[36m[1m### Step 1
Action: Start the server using `npm start`.
Expected result: You should see the message "Server running at http://localhost:3000" indicating that the server has successfully started.

### Step 2
Action: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000/auth/register.
Expected result: You should see a registration form with fields for Username, Password, Role, Specialty (Doctors only), and Localization (Doctors only).

### Step 3
Action: Fill out the registration form with details for a doctor user. Make sure to select "Doctor" as the role. Fill in the Specialty and Localization fields that appear when "Doctor" is selected. Click the "Register" button.
Expected result: After clicking "Register", you should be redirected to the login page at http://localhost:3000/auth/login.

### Step 4
Action: Log in with the doctor account you just created by entering the username and password you registered with and clicking the "Login" button.
Expected result: You should be redirected to the homepage of the app with a message indicating successful login or simply seeing the homepage indicating you're logged in.

### Step 5
Action: Visit http://localhost:3000/doctor/availability in your web browser.
Expected result: You should see a form titled "Post Your Availability" with fields to enter a date and available hours.

### Step 6
Action: Fill in the date and available hours (e.g., "18:00 - 06:00") in the form, and click the "Post Availability" button.
Expected result: After clicking the button, you should be redirected to the homepage of the app. This indicates that the availability information was successfully posted.

### Step 7
Action: To verify that the information was saved to the database, you would need direct access to the MongoDB database which goes beyond the scope of these instructions. However, if no errors were encountered and you were redirected back to the homepage after posting availability, it is a strong indicator that the operation was successful.[0m
[33m[1m

If you want to run the app, just type "r" and press ENTER and that will run `npm start`[0m
```


User wrote this feedback:
```
logging of posting the availability should be provided
```


Your job is to identify if feedback is good enough for you to solve the problem. If not, what information you need to solve the problem. Ask for any information that you need to solve the problem.
If you have enough information don't ask any questions.

When thinking of questions, consider the following:
- After getting answers to your questions, you must be able to solve the problem.
- Ask only crucial questions. Do not ask for information that you do not need to solve the problem.
- Ask least amount of questions to get the most information and to solve the problem.
- Ask only questions from the list provided bellow.
- Ask questions in same order as they are in the list.
- Never repeat same question.

Here is the list of questions you can ask:
"Can you please provide more information on what exactly you mean?"
"Can you please provide logs from the frontend?"
"Can you please provide logs from the backend?"
"What is the expected behavior?"
"What is the actual behavior?"
"On what page does the issue happen?"

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Project architecture:
The Giełda_dyżurowa application will follow a traditional three-tier web application architecture, consisting of a presentation layer (frontend), an application layer (backend), and a data layer (database). The frontend will be built using EJS for templating, Bootstrap for CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for interactions, providing a responsive user interface for both doctors and hospitals to interact with. The backend will be developed using Node.js and the Express framework, handling all business logic, including user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties. MongoDB, coupled with Mongoose ORM, will be used as the database to store and manage user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts efficiently.

Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

* Node.js - JavaScript runtime for building apps. This is required to be able to run the app you're building.
* MongoDB - NoSQL database. If you don't want to install MongoDB locally, you can use a cloud version such as MongoDB Atlas.
* express - Express web server for Node
* mongoose - Mongoose ORM for MongoDB
* bcrypt - Library for hashing passwords
* express-session - Middleware for session management in Express
* dotenv - Module to load environment variables from a .env file
* ejs - Templating engine for rendering views


Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```
You are currently working on task "Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours." and you have to focus only on that task.

User who was using the app "Giełda_dyżurowa" sent you this feedback:
```
logging of posting the availability should be provided
```
Feedback was not clear enough so you asked user for additional information and got this response:
```
Q: What is the expected behavior?
A: log of posting availability

Q: What is the actual behavior?
A: no logging

```

Now, you have to debug this issue and comply with the additional user feedback.

**IMPORTANT**
Think about all information provided. Your job is to look at big picture by analysing all files to find where the issue is.
Don't reply with any code, your thoughts or breakdown of the issue. Respond only with description of solution, explaining what should be steps in solving the issue.
Create as little steps as possible to fix the issue. Each step should describe, using sentences and not code, what changes are needed in specific file or describe command that needs to be executed to continue working on the issue.
When there are multiple things that have to be done in one file write everything as one step and don't split it in multiple steps.
You can count that the environment is set up previously and packages listed in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation of new dependencies, if there are any.

**IMPORTANT**
If report mentions *multiple* issues, treat it as if you got several separate reports: think through each, and provide solutions for each.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file.

To address the user feedback regarding the lack of logging when posting doctor availability, follow these steps:

1. In the file **routes/doctorAvailabilityRoutes.js**, within the `router.post('/doctor/availability', isAuthenticated, isDoctor, async (req, res) => {...}` route handler, right after the line where the availability is created and saved to the database (right after `const availability = await DoctorAvailability.create({...});`), add a logging statement using `console.log()`. This log should include the message "Availability posted successfully" along with the `doctorId`, `date`, and `availableHours` to provide clear information about the posting action for debugging and monitoring purposes.

To address the user feedback regarding the lack of logging when posting doctor availability, follow these steps:

1. In the file **routes/doctorAvailabilityRoutes.js**, within the `router.post('/doctor/availability', isAuthenticated, isDoctor, async (req, res) => {...}` route handler, right after the line where the availability is created and saved to the database (right after `const availability = await DoctorAvailability.create({...});`), add a logging statement using `console.log()`. This log should include the message "Availability posted successfully" along with the `doctorId`, `date`, and `availableHours` to provide clear information about the posting action for debugging and monitoring purposes.

Ok, now, take your previous message that starts with `To address the user feedback` and ends with `for debugging and monitoring purposes.` and convert it to a list of actionable steps that will be executed by a machine. Analyze the entire message, think step by step and make sure that you don't omit any information when converting this message to steps.

Each step can be either:

* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a Linux machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)
* `save_file` - create or update ONE file
* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done. Also you MUST NOT use `human_intervention` to ask the human to write or review code.

**IMPORTANT**: In `code_change_description` field of `save_file` step, you must provide empty string. If multiple changes are required for same file, you must provide single `save_file` step for each file.

When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember, NEVER output human intervention steps to do manual tests or coding tasks, even if the previous message asks for it! The testing will be done *after* these steps and you MUST NOT include testing in these steps.

I need to modify file `/routes/doctorAvailabilityRoutes.js` that currently looks like this:
```
const express = require('express');
const DoctorAvailability = require('../models/DoctorAvailability');
const { isAuthenticated } = require('./middleware/authMiddleware');

const router = express.Router();

// Middleware to ensure only doctors can access certain routes
const isDoctor = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.session.role === 'doctor') {
    next();
  } else {
    console.log(`Access denied. Role: ${req.session.role}, Required: doctor`);
    res.status(403).send('Access denied. Only doctors can perform this action.');
  }
};

router.get('/doctor/availability', isAuthenticated, isDoctor, (req, res) => {
  res.render('doctorAvailability');
});

router.post('/doctor/availability', isAuthenticated, isDoctor, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { date, availableHours } = req.body;
    const doctorId = req.session.userId; // Assuming session stores userId
    const availability = await DoctorAvailability.create({
      doctorId,
      date,
      availableHours,
    });
    console.log(`Availability posted successfully by Doctor ID: ${doctorId}`);
    res.redirect('/'); // Redirect to a confirmation page or back to the form
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error posting availability:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Error while posting availability. Please try again later.');
  }
});

```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

Here is the diff of the changes:

## Hunk 1

-    console.log(`Availability posted successfully by Doctor ID: ${doctorId}`);
+    console.log(`Availability posted successfully by Doctor ID: ${doctorId}, Date: ${date}, Available Hours: ${availableHours}`);
     res.redirect('/'); // Redirect to a confirmation page or back to the form
   } catch (error) {
-    console.error('Error posting availability:', error);

+    console.error(error.stack);
     res.status(500).send('Error while posting availability. Please try again later.');
   }
 });
```


As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/routes/doctorAvailabilityRoutes.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

```

Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```
You are currently working on task "Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours." and you have to focus only on that task.

A part of the app is already finished.

---end_of_current_files---
While working on this task, your colleague who is testing the app "Giełda_dyżurowa" sent you some additional info. Here it is:
```
logging of posting the availability should be provided
```

After this info, you tried to fix it. Files that were modified during implementation of the task are:
```
['/models/DoctorAvailability.js', '/routes/doctorAvailabilityRoutes.js', '/views/doctorAvailability.ejs', '/server.js']
```

Now I will show you how those files looked before this task implementation started. If a file is listed as the file that changed but is not in this list that means it was created during this task. Here are files before implementation of this task:

---end_of_files_at_start_of_task---
**IMPORTANT**
You have to review this task implementation. You are known to be very strict with your reviews and very good at noticing bugs but you don't mind minor changes like refactoring, adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.

Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.
In this review, your goal is to check:
1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.
2. If new files or functions are created but never called or used.
3. If there is some "dead code" that should be removed.
4. If there is some duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.

If everything is ok respond only with "DONE" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything is ok, respond just with "DONE".

If you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":

Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."

Think about this output and not any output in previous messages. If the command was successfully executed, respond with `DONE`. If it wasn't, respond with `BUG`.

Do not respond with anything other than these two keywords.

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

```

Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```
You are currently working on task "Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours." and you have to focus only on that task.

A part of the app is already finished.

While working on this task, your colleague who is testing the app "Giełda_dyżurowa" sent you some additional info. Here it is:
```
logging of posting the availability should be provided
```

After this info, you tried to fix it. Files that were modified during implementation of the task are:
```
['/models/DoctorAvailability.js', '/routes/doctorAvailabilityRoutes.js', '/views/doctorAvailability.ejs', '/server.js']
```

Now I will show you how those files looked before this task implementation started. If a file is listed as the file that changed but is not in this list that means it was created during this task. Here are files before implementation of this task:

---end_of_files_at_start_of_task---
**IMPORTANT**
You have to review this task implementation. You are known to be very strict with your reviews and very good at noticing bugs but you don't mind minor changes like refactoring, adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.

Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.
In this review, your goal is to check:
1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.
2. If new files or functions are created but never called or used.
3. If there is some "dead code" that should be removed.
4. If there is some duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.

If everything is ok respond only with "DONE" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything is ok, respond just with "DONE".

If you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for "Giełda_dyżurowa" as well.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Here is a short description of the project architecture:
The Giełda_dyżurowa application will follow a traditional three-tier web application architecture, consisting of a presentation layer (frontend), an application layer (backend), and a data layer (database). The frontend will be built using EJS for templating, Bootstrap for CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for interactions, providing a responsive user interface for both doctors and hospitals to interact with. The backend will be developed using Node.js and the Express framework, handling all business logic, including user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties. MongoDB, coupled with Mongoose ORM, will be used as the database to store and manage user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts efficiently.

Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

* Node.js - JavaScript runtime for building apps. This is required to be able to run the app you're building.
* MongoDB - NoSQL database. If you don't want to install MongoDB locally, you can use a cloud version such as MongoDB Atlas.
* express - Express web server for Node
* mongoose - Mongoose ORM for MongoDB
* bcrypt - Library for hashing passwords
* express-session - Middleware for session management in Express
* dotenv - Module to load environment variables from a .env file
* ejs - Templating engine for rendering views



Here are files that are currently implemented:

We've broken the development of this app down to these tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```

You are currently working on task #4 with the following description:
```
Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.
```
All previous tasks are finished and you don't have to work on them.

Now, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands that need to be run to implement this task.

**IMPORTANT**
Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.

DO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written. When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."
------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**
When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file.

Never use the port 5000 to run the app, it's reserved.

To implement the feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
No new dependencies are required for this task as all necessary packages are already included in the project.

### Step 2: Update Models
We need to create a new model for storing messages of interest sent by doctors to hospitals regarding duty slots.

**File: models/InterestMessage.js**
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const interestMessageSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  dutySlotId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'DutySlot', required: true },
  doctorId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  hospitalId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  message: { type: String, default: 'I am interested in this duty slot.' },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});

const InterestMessage = mongoose.model('InterestMessage', interestMessageSchema);

module.exports = InterestMessage;
```

### Step 3: Create the Duty Browse Route and View
We need a route to display all duty slots to doctors and a view for them to browse through.

**File: routes/dutyRoutes.js**
Add the following code to the existing file:

```javascript
const InterestMessage = require('../models/InterestMessage'); // Add this line at the top with other requires

// Middleware to ensure only doctors can access certain routes
const isDoctor = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.session.role === 'doctor') {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(403).send('Access denied. Only doctors can perform this action.');
  }
};

router.get('/duty/browse', isAuthenticated, isDoctor, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const dutySlots = await DutySlot.find().populate('hospitalId', 'username');
    res.render('dutyBrowse', { dutySlots });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching duty slots:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Error fetching duty slots');
  }
});

router.post('/duty/interest/:id', isAuthenticated, isDoctor, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const dutySlotId = req.params.id;
    const doctorId = req.session.userId;
    const dutySlot = await DutySlot.findById(dutySlotId);
    if (!dutySlot) {
      return res.status(404).send('Duty slot not found.');
    }
    await InterestMessage.create({
      dutySlotId,
      doctorId,
      hospitalId: dutySlot.hospitalId,
    });
    res.redirect('/duty/browse');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending interest:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Error sending interest');
  }
});
```

**File: views/dutyBrowse.ejs**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<%- include('partials/_head.ejs') %>
  <body>
<%- include('partials/_header.ejs') %>
    <main class="container mt-5">
      <h2>Browse Duty Slots</h2>
      <% dutySlots.forEach(function(slot) { %>
        <div class="card mb-3">
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Duty Slot on <%= slot.date.toDateString() %></h5>
            <p class="card-text"><strong>Hours:</strong> <%= slot.dutyHours %></p>
            <p class="card-text"><strong>Specialty Required:</strong> <%= slot.requiredSpecialty %></p>
            <p class="card-text"><strong>Hospital:</strong> <%= slot.hospitalId.username %></p>
            <form action="/duty/interest/<%= slot._id %>" method="POST">
              <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Express Interest</button>
            </form>
          </div>
        </div>
      <% }); %>
    </main>
  </body>
<%- include('partials/_footer.ejs') %>
</html>
```

This completes the implementation of the feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors.

To implement the feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
No new dependencies are required for this task as all necessary packages are already included in the project.

### Step 2: Update Models
We need to create a new model for storing messages of interest sent by doctors to hospitals regarding duty slots.

**File: models/InterestMessage.js**
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const interestMessageSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  dutySlotId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'DutySlot', required: true },
  doctorId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  hospitalId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  message: { type: String, default: 'I am interested in this duty slot.' },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});

const InterestMessage = mongoose.model('InterestMessage', interestMessageSchema);

module.exports = InterestMessage;
```

### Step 3: Create the Duty Browse Route and View
We need a route to display all duty slots to doctors and a view for them to browse through.

**File: routes/dutyRoutes.js**
Add the following code to the existing file:

```javascript
const InterestMessage = require('../models/InterestMessage'); // Add this line at the top with other requires

// Middleware to ensure only doctors can access certain routes
const isDoctor = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.session.role === 'doctor') {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(403).send('Access denied. Only doctors can perform this action.');
  }
};

router.get('/duty/browse', isAuthenticated, isDoctor, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const dutySlots = await DutySlot.find().populate('hospitalId', 'username');
    res.render('dutyBrowse', { dutySlots });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching duty slots:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Error fetching duty slots');
  }
});

router.post('/duty/interest/:id', isAuthenticated, isDoctor, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const dutySlotId = req.params.id;
    const doctorId = req.session.userId;
    const dutySlot = await DutySlot.findById(dutySlotId);
    if (!dutySlot) {
      return res.status(404).send('Duty slot not found.');
    }
    await InterestMessage.create({
      dutySlotId,
      doctorId,
      hospitalId: dutySlot.hospitalId,
    });
    res.redirect('/duty/browse');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending interest:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Error sending interest');
  }
});
```

**File: views/dutyBrowse.ejs**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<%- include('partials/_head.ejs') %>
  <body>
<%- include('partials/_header.ejs') %>
    <main class="container mt-5">

>>>>>>>>>> User Prompt >>>>>>>>>>
Ok, now, take your previous message that starts with `To implement the feature for` and ends with `for duty slots for doctors.` and convert it to a list of actionable steps that will be executed by a machine. Analyze the entire message, think step by step and make sure that you don't omit any information when converting this message to steps.

Each step can be either:

* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a Linux machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)
* `save_file` - create or update ONE file
* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done. Also you MUST NOT use `human_intervention` to ask the human to write or review code.

**IMPORTANT**: In `code_change_description` field of `save_file` step, you must provide empty string. If multiple changes are required for same file, you must provide single `save_file` step for each file.

When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember, NEVER output human intervention steps to do manual tests or coding tasks, even if the previous message asks for it! The testing will be done *after* these steps and you MUST NOT include testing in these steps.

Analyze the entire message, think step by step and make sure that you don\'t omit any information when converting this message to steps.\n\nEach step can be either:\n\n* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a Linux machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)\n* `save_file` - create or update ONE file\n* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done. Also you MUST NOT use `human_intervention` to ask the human to write or review code.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: In `code_change_description` field of `save_file` step, you must provide empty string. If multiple changes are required for same file, you must provide single `save_file` step for each file.\n\nWhen creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.\n\nAll the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Remember, NEVER output human intervention steps to do manual tests or coding tasks, even if the previous message asks for it! The testing will be done *after* these steps and you MUST NOT include testing in these steps.\n\nExamples:\n------------------------example_1---------------------------\n```\n{\n  "tasks": [\n    {\n      "type": "save_file",\n      "save_file": {\n        "name": "server.js",\n        "path": "/server.js",\n        "code_change_description": "",\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      "type": "command",\n      "command": {\n        "command": "ls",\n        "timeout": "5000",\n        "success_message": "README.md",\n        "command_id": "check_existence_of_readme_file"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{"tasks": [{"type": "save_file", "save_file": {"name": "InterestMessage.js", "path": "/models/InterestMessage.js", "code_change_description": ""}}, {"type": "save_file", "save_file": {"name": "dutyRoutes.js", "path": "/routes/dutyRoutes.js", "code_change_description": ""}}, {"type": "save_file", "save_file": {"name": "dutyBrowse.ejs", "path": "/views/dutyBrowse.ejs", "code_change_description": ""}}]}'}]

>>>>>>>>>> User Prompt >>>>>>>>>>
I need to modify file `/models/InterestMessage.js` that currently looks like this:
```

```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/models/InterestMessage.js`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```

```

Here is the diff of the changes:

## Hunk 1
```diff

+
+const InterestMessage = mongoose.model('InterestMessage', interestMessageSchema);
+
+module.exports = InterestMessage;
```


As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/models/InterestMessage.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/routes/dutyRoutes.js`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```
const express = require('express');
const DutySlot = require('../models/DutySlot');
const { isAuthenticated } = require('./middleware/authMiddleware');

const router = express.Router();

// Middleware to ensure only hospitals can access certain routes
const isHospital = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.session.role === 'hospital') {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(403).send('Access denied. Only hospitals can perform this action.');
  }
};

router.get('/duty/publish', isAuthenticated, isHospital, (req, res) => {
  res.render('dutyPublish');
});

router.post('/duty/publish', isAuthenticated, isHospital, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { date, dutyHours, requiredSpecialty } = req.body;
    const hospitalId = req.session.userId; // Assuming session stores userId
    const newDutySlot = await DutySlot.create({
      date,
      dutyHours,
      requiredSpecialty,
      hospitalId,
    });
    console.log(`New duty slot created: ${newDutySlot}`);
    res.redirect('/'); // Redirect to a confirmation page or back to the form
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating duty slot:', error);
    console.error(error.stack);
    res.status(500).send('Error while publishing duty slot. Please try again later.');
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

As you can see, there are 3 hunks in this diff, and each starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/routes/dutyRoutes.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:\n* applied - if the change is correct\n* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn\'t asked for\n* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect\n\nFinally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you\'re just reviewing one file, `/routes/dutyRoutes.js`. You don\'t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.\n\nNote that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that\'s not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don\'t ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it\'s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important.

Reviewer feedback:
This hunk correctly adds the route for browsing duty slots and the route for sending interest messages. However, it's crucial to note that the 'populate' method on 'DutySlot.find()' is used incorrectly. The code attempts to populate 'hospitalId' with 'username', but 'hospitalId' refers to a User model that does not directly contain 'username' at the top level; it should populate 'hospitalId' as a whole object. Additionally, there should be error handling for the case where a duty slot or user does not exist when sending an interest message.

Review notes:
Overall, the implementation aligns with the task requirements. However, attention should be paid to the correct use of Mongoose's populate method and the error handling around it. It's also important to ensure that the 'hospitalId' field is populated correctly to retrieve the necessary information about the hospital posting the duty slot.

Based on this feedback and the original instructions, think carefully, make the correct changes, and output the entire file again. Remember, Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/routes/dutyRoutes.js`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```
const express = require('express');
const DutySlot = require('../models/DutySlot');
const { isAuthenticated } = require('./middleware/authMiddleware');

const router = express.Router();

// Middleware to ensure only hospitals can access certain routes

  if (req.session.role === 'hospital') {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(403).send('Access denied. Only hospitals can perform this action.');
  }
};

router.get('/duty/publish', isAuthenticated, isHospital, (req, res) => {

As you can see, there are 3 hunks in this diff, and each starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/routes/dutyRoutes.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:\n* applied - if the change is correct\n* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn\'t asked for\n* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect\n\nFinally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you\'re just reviewing one file, `/routes/dutyRoutes.js`. You don\'t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.\n\nNote that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that\'s not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don\'t ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it\'s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 2,\n            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 3,\n            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",\n            "decision": "ignore"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 4,\n            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",\n            "decision": "rework"\n        },\n    ],\n    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted.

I need to modify file `/views/dutyBrowse.ejs` that currently looks like this:
```

```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/views/dutyBrowse.ejs`.

Here is the original content of this file:

Here is the diff of the changes:

```


As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/views/dutyBrowse.ejs`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:\n* applied - if the change is correct\n* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn\'t asked for\n* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect\n\nFinally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you\'re just reviewing one file, `/views/dutyBrowse.ejs`. You don\'t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.\n\nNote that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that\'s not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don\'t ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it\'s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important.

Do not reply with anything else but the command with which I can run this app with.
For example, if the command is "python app.py", then your response needs to be only `python app.py` without the `

Pay attention to file paths: if the command or argument is a file or folder from the project, use paths relative to the project root (for example, use `./somefile` instead of `/somefile`).

If there is no command to run reply with empty response.

How can a human user test if this task was completed successfully?

Please list actions, step by step, in order, that the user should take to verify the task. After each action, describe what the expected response is.

**IMPORTANT**

Follow these important rules when compiling a list of actions the user will take:

1. Actions must be as specific as possible. You don't want the user to have to think anything through but rather that they just follow your instructions.
2. In case this task can be tested by making an API request, you should always prefer to test functionality in the browser. In case you can't do that, do not suggest how can a request be made with Postman but rather write a full cURL command that the user can just run.
3. Do not require the user to write any code or edit files to test this task.
4. If the user must run a command, assume the user already has a terminal opened in the project root directory (no need to instruct the user "open the terminal" or "make sure you're in the project directory")
5. The user is using Linux, so the commands must run on that operating system
6. Assume system services, such as the database, are already set up and running. Don't ask user to install or run any software other than the app they're testing.
7. Don't ask the user to test things which aren't implemented yet (eg. opening a theoretical web page that doesn't exist yet, or clicking on a button that isn't implemented yet)

Remember, these rules are very important and you must follow them!

Here is an example output with a few user steps:
---example---
### Step 1
Action: Start the server using `npm start`
Expected result: You should see the message "Connected to database" or similar

### Step 2
Action: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000/
Expected result: Web page opens and you see a "Hello World" message with a contact form

### Step 3
Action: Click on the "Submit" button in the web form
Expected result: Form is submitted, page is reloaded and "Thank you" message is shown
---end_of_example---

If nothing needs to be tested for this task, instead of outputting the steps, just output a single word: DONE

2024-03-22 07:44:00,114 [llm_connection.py:540 - stream_gpt_completion() ] INFO: <<<<<<<<<< LLM Response <<<<<<<<<<
### Step 1
Action: Start the server using `npm start`.
Expected result: You should see messages indicating the server is running, including "Server running at http://localhost:[yourPort]", and "Database connected successfully".

### Step 2
Action: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000/auth/login.
Expected result: You should see a login page with fields for "Username" and "Password", and a "Login" button.

### Step 3
Action: Log in as a doctor. Use the credentials of a doctor user that you previously registered. If you haven't registered a doctor user yet, first visit http://localhost:3000/auth/register and create a doctor account by selecting "Doctor" as the role and filling out the required fields, then log in with this account.
Expected result: After logging in, you should be redirected to the home page of the application.

### Step 4
Action: Navigate to http://localhost:3000/duty/browse.
Expected result: You should see a list of duty slots published by hospitals, including details such as the date, duty hours, required specialty, and the hospital's username. Each duty slot should have a "Express Interest" button next to it.

### Step 5
Action: Click on the "Express Interest" button for any listed duty slot.
Expected result: The page should refresh, and you should remain on the "Browse Duty Slots" page. This action simulates sending a message of interest to the hospital that posted the duty slot. 

### Step 6
Action: To verify the interest message was sent, a database check would be required to see if the InterestMessage document was created. Since the task instructions limit actions to those not requiring code changes or database commands, this step cannot be directly observed through the UI without further implementation.
Expected result: Since direct verification through the UI is not possible for this step, no further action can be taken to verify the interest message without additional development or database access.

### Step 1
Action: Start the server using `npm start`.
Expected result: You should see messages indicating the server is running, including "Server running at http://localhost:[yourPort]", and "Database connected successfully".

### Step 2
Action: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000/auth/login.
Expected result: You should see a login page with fields for "Username" and "Password", and a "Login" button.

### Step 3
Action: Log in as a doctor. Use the credentials of a doctor user that you previously registered. If you haven't registered a doctor user yet, first visit http://localhost:3000/auth/register and create a doctor account by selecting "Doctor" as the role and filling out the required fields, then log in with this account.
Expected result: After logging in, you should be redirected to the home page of the application.

### Step 4
Action: Navigate to http://localhost:3000/duty/browse.
Expected result: You should see a list of duty slots published by hospitals, including details such as the date, duty hours, required specialty, and the hospital's username. Each duty slot should have a "Express Interest" button next to it.

### Step 5
Action: Click on the "Express Interest" button for any listed duty slot.
Expected result: The page should refresh, and you should remain on the "Browse Duty Slots" page. This action simulates sending a message of interest to the hospital that posted the duty slot. 

### Step 6
Action: To verify the interest message was sent, a database check would be required to see if the InterestMessage document was created. Since the task instructions limit actions to those not requiring code changes or database commands, this step cannot be directly observed through the UI without further implementation.
Expected result: Since direct verification through the UI is not possible for this step, no further action can be taken to verify the interest message without additional development or database access.

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

```

Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```
You are currently working on task "Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database." and you have to focus only on that task.

A part of the app is already finished.

**IMPORTANT**
You have to review this task implementation. You are known to be very strict with your reviews and very good at noticing bugs but you don't mind minor changes like refactoring, adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.

Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.
In this review, your goal is to check:
1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.
2. If new files or functions are created but never called or used.
3. If there is some "dead code" that should be removed.
4. If there is some duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.

If everything is ok respond only with "DONE" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything is ok, respond just with "DONE".

If you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."

Think about this output and not any output in previous messages. If the command was successfully executed, respond with `DONE`. If it wasn't, respond with `BUG`.

Do not respond with anything other than these two keywords.

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```
You are currently working on task "Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database." and you have to focus only on that task.

Now I will show you how those files looked before this task implementation started. If a file is listed as the file that changed but is not in this list that means it was created during this task. Here are files before implementation of this task:

**IMPORTANT**
You have to review this task implementation. You are known to be very strict with your reviews and very good at noticing bugs but you don't mind minor changes like refactoring, adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.

Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.
In this review, your goal is to check:
1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.
2. If new files or functions are created but never called or used.
3. If there is some "dead code" that should be removed.
4. If there is some duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.

If everything is ok respond only with "DONE" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything is ok, respond just with "DONE".

If you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."
------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to create a detailed documentation for current state of project. Your first task is to create README.md file.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for "Giełda_dyżurowa" as well.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Here is a short description of the project architecture:
The Giełda_dyżurowa application will follow a traditional three-tier web application architecture, consisting of a presentation layer (frontend), an application layer (backend), and a data layer (database). The frontend will be built using EJS for templating, Bootstrap for CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for interactions, providing a responsive user interface for both doctors and hospitals to interact with. The backend will be developed using Node.js and the Express framework, handling all business logic, including user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties. MongoDB, coupled with Mongoose ORM, will be used as the database to store and manage user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts efficiently.

Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

* Node.js - JavaScript runtime for building apps. This is required to be able to run the app you're building.
* MongoDB - NoSQL database. If you don't want to install MongoDB locally, you can use a cloud version such as MongoDB Atlas.
* express - Express web server for Node
* mongoose - Mongoose ORM for MongoDB
* bcrypt - Library for hashing passwords
* express-session - Middleware for session management in Express
* dotenv - Module to load environment variables from a .env file
* ejs - Templating engine for rendering views



Here are files that are currently implemented:

We've broken the development of this app down to these tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```

You are currently working on task #5 with the following description:
```
Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.
```
All previous tasks are finished and you don't have to work on them.

Now, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands that need to be run to implement this task.

**IMPORTANT**
Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.

DO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written. When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":

Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."
------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**
When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file.

Never use the port 5000 to run the app, it's reserved.

To implement task #5, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Update the User Model

File: `/models/User.js`

Add a `profileVisible` field of Boolean type to the `userSchema`:

```javascript
profileVisible: { type: Boolean, default: true },
```

This should be added within the `userSchema` definition, making the updated schema look something like this:

```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  role: { type: String, required: true, enum: ['doctor', 'hospital'] },
  specialty: { type: String, required: false },
  localization: { type: String, required: false },
  profileVisible: { type: Boolean, default: true }, // New field
});
```

### Step 2: Create Hospital Profile Viewing Route and View

File: `/routes/profileRoutes.js`

Create a new file to handle profile-related routes. Add the following code to handle the hospital profile view:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const User = require('../models/User');
const { isAuthenticated } = require('./middleware/authMiddleware');

// Hospital Profile Viewing Route
router.get('/hospital/profile/:id', isAuthenticated, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.findById(req.params.id);
    if (!user || user.role !== 'hospital' || !user.profileVisible) {
      return res.status(404).send('Profile is not available.');
    }
    res.render('hospitalProfile', { user });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching hospital profile:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Error fetching profile');
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

File: `/views/hospitalProfile.ejs`

Create a new view to display hospital profiles:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<%- include('partials/_head.ejs') %>
  <body>
<%- include('partials/_header.ejs') %>
    <main class="container mt-5">
      <h2>Hospital Profile: <%= user.username %></h2>
      <p><strong>Specialty:</strong> <%= user.specialty %></p>
      <p><strong>Localization:</strong> <%= user.localization %></p>
    </main>
  </body>
<%- include('partials/_footer.ejs') %>
</html>
```

### Step 3: Create Doctor Profile Viewing Route and View

Continue adding to the same file created in Step 2 for the doctor profile route.

File: `/routes/profileRoutes.js`

Add the following route for doctor profile viewing:

```javascript
// Doctor Profile Viewing Route
router.get('/doctor/profile/:id', isAuthenticated, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.findById(req.params.id);
    if (!user || user.role !== 'doctor' || !user.profileVisible) {
      return res.status(404).send('Profile is not available.');
    }
    res.render('doctorProfile', { user });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching doctor profile:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Error fetching profile');
  }
});
```

File: `/views/doctorProfile.ejs`

Create a new view to display doctor profiles:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<%- include('partials/_head.ejs') %>
  <body>
<%- include('partials/_header.ejs') %>
    <main class="container mt-5">
      <h2>Doctor Profile: <%= user.username %></h2>
      <p><strong>Specialty:</strong> <%= user.specialty %></p>
      <p><strong>Localization:</strong> <%= user.localization %></p>
    </main>
  </body>
<%- include('partials/_footer.ejs') %>
</html>
```

### Step 4: Integrate Profile Routes into the Application

File: `/server.js`

Import the newly created `profileRoutes` and use them with the app:

```javascript
const profileRoutes = require('./routes/profileRoutes');
// Use profile routes
app.use(profileRoutes);
```

### Step 5: Ensure Authentication Middleware is Properly Configured

Verify that the `isAuthenticated` middleware in `/routes/middleware/authMiddleware.js` is correctly implemented as provided previously. This middleware is critical for ensuring that only authenticated users can access the profile viewing routes.

These steps complete the implementation of task #5, enabling profile viewing functionality with visibility control.

Analyze the entire message, think step by step and make sure that you don't omit any information when converting this message to steps.

Each step can be either:

* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a Linux machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)
* `save_file` - create or update ONE file
* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done. Also you MUST NOT use `human_intervention` to ask the human to write or review code.

**IMPORTANT**: In `code_change_description` field of `save_file` step, you must provide empty string. If multiple changes are required for same file, you must provide single `save_file` step for each file.

When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember, NEVER output human intervention steps to do manual tests or coding tasks, even if the previous message asks for it! The testing will be done *after* these steps and you MUST NOT include testing in these steps.

I need to modify file `/models/User.js` that currently looks like this:
```
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  role: { type: String, required: true, enum: ['doctor', 'hospital'] },
  specialty: { type: String, required: false },
  localization: { type: String, required: false }
});

userSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  const user = this;
  if (!user.isModified('password')) return next();
  bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10, (err, hash) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error hashing password:', err);
      return next(err);
    }
    user.password = hash;
    next();
  });
});

userSchema.pre('validate', function(next) {
  if (this.role === 'doctor' && (!this.specialty || !this.localization)) {
    const err = new Error('Specialty and Localization are required for doctors.');
    console.error('Validation error:', err);
    next(err);
  } else {
    next();
  }
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

module.exports = User;
```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/models/User.js`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  role: { type: String, required: true, enum: ['doctor', 'hospital'] },
  specialty: { type: String, required: false },
  localization: { type: String, required: false }
});

userSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  const user = this;
  if (!user.isModified('password')) return next();
  bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10, (err, hash) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error hashing password:', err);
      return next(err);
    }
    user.password = hash;
    next();
  });
});

userSchema.pre('validate', function(next) {
  if (this.role === 'doctor' && (!this.specialty || !this.localization)) {
    const err = new Error('Specialty and Localization are required for doctors.');
    console.error('Validation error:', err);
    next(err);
  } else {
    next();
  }
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

module.exports = User;
```

Here is the diff of the changes:

   } else {
     next();
```


As you can see, there are 3 hunks in this diff, and each starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/models/User.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:\n* applied - if the change is correct\n* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn\'t asked for\n* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect\n\nFinally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you\'re just reviewing one file, `/models/User.js`. You don\'t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.\n\nNote that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that\'s not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don\'t ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it\'s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important.

I need to modify file `/routes/profileRoutes.js` that currently looks like this:
```

```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/routes/profileRoutes.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:\n* applied - if the change is correct\n* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn\'t asked for\n* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect\n\nFinally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you\'re just reviewing one file, `/routes/profileRoutes.js`. You don\'t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.\n\nNote that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that\'s not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don\'t ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it\'s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 2,\n            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 3,\n            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",\n            "decision": "ignore"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 4,\n            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",\n            "decision": "rework"\n        },\n    ],\n    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted.

I need to modify file `/views/hospitalProfile.ejs` that currently looks like this:
```

```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/views/hospitalProfile.ejs`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```

```

Here is the diff of the changes:

## Hunk 1
```diff
@@ -0,0 +1,13 @@
+<!DOCTYPE html>
+<html lang="en">
+<%- include('partials/_head.ejs') %>
+  <body>
+<%- include('partials/_header.ejs') %>
+    <main class="container mt-5">
+      <h2>Hospital Profile: <%= user.username %></h2>
+      <p><strong>Specialty:</strong> <%= user.specialty %></p>
+      <p><strong>Localization:</strong> <%= user.localization %></p>
+    </main>
+  </body>
+<%- include('partials/_footer.ejs') %>
+</html>
```


As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/views/hospitalProfile.ejs`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/views/hospitalProfile.ejs`.\n\nHere is the original content of this file:\n```\n\n```\n\nHere is the diff of the changes:\n\n## Hunk 1\n```diff\n@@ -0,0 +1,13 @@\n+<!DOCTYPE html>\n+<html lang="en">\n+<%- include(\'partials/_head.ejs\') %>\n+  <body>\n+<%- include(\'partials/_header.ejs\') %>\n+    <main class="container mt-5">\n+      <h2>Hospital Profile: <%= user.username %></h2>\n+      <p><strong>Specialty:</strong> <%= user.specialty %></p>\n+      <p><strong>Localization:</strong> <%= user.localization %></p>\n+    </main>\n+  </body>\n+<%- include(\'partials/_footer.ejs\') %>\n+</html>\n```\n\n\nAs you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.\n\nThink carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:\n* applied - if the change is correct\n* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn\'t asked for\n* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect\n\nFinally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you\'re just reviewing one file, `/views/hospitalProfile.ejs`. You don\'t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.\n\nNote that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that\'s not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don\'t ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it\'s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 2,\n            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 3,\n            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",\n            "decision": "ignore"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 4,\n            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",\n            "decision": "rework"\n        },\n    ],\n    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{"hunks": [{"number": 1, "reason": "The hunk correctly implements the structure and content for the hospital profile page as requested.

I need to modify file `/views/doctorProfile.ejs` that currently looks like this:
```

```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/views/doctorProfile.ejs`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```

```

Here is the diff of the changes:

## Hunk 1
```diff

+<!DOCTYPE html>

+<%- include('partials/_footer.ejs') %>
+</html>
```


As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/views/doctorProfile.ejs`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn\'t contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Error handling\nWhenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn\'t be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/server.js`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```
// Load environment variables
require("dotenv").config();
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const express = require("express");
const session = require("express-session");
const MongoStore = require('connect-mongo');
const authRoutes = require("./routes/authRoutes");
const dutyRoutes = require('./routes/dutyRoutes');
const doctorAvailabilityRoutes = require('./routes/doctorAvailabilityRoutes');

if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL || !process.env.SESSION_SECRET) {
  console.error("Error: config environment variables not set. Please create/edit .env configuration file.");
  process.exit(-1);
}

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Middleware to parse request bodies
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());

// Setting the templating engine to EJS
app.set("view engine", "ejs");

// Serve static files
app.use(express.static("public"));

// Database connection
mongoose
  .connect(process.env.DATABASE_URL)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Database connected successfully");
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(`Database connection error: ${err.message}`);
    console.error(err.stack);
    process.exit(1);
  });

// Session configuration with connect-mongo
app.use(
  session({
    secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: MongoStore.create({ mongoUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL }),
  }),
);

app.on("error", (error) => {
  console.error(`Server error: ${error.message}`);
  console.error(error.stack);
});

// Logging session creation and destruction
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const sess = req.session;
  // Make session available to all views
  res.locals.session = sess;
  if (!sess.views) {
    sess.views = 1;
    console.log("Session created at: ", new Date().toISOString());
  } else {
    sess.views++;
    console.log(
      `Session accessed again at: ${new Date().toISOString()}, Views: ${sess.views}, User ID: ${sess.userId || '(unauthenticated)'}`,
    );
  }
  next();
});

// Authentication Routes
app.use(authRoutes);

// Duty Routes
app.use(dutyRoutes);

// Doctor Availability Routes
app.use(doctorAvailabilityRoutes);

// Root path response
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.render("index");
});

// If no routes handled the request, it's a 404
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.status(404).send("Page not found.");
});

// Error handling
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(`Unhandled application error: ${err.message}`);
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send("There was an error serving your request.");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});

```

Here is the diff of the changes:

## Hunk 1

```


As you can see, there are 3 hunks in this diff, and each starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/server.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:\n* applied - if the change is correct\n* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn\'t asked for\n* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect\n\nFinally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you\'re just reviewing one file, `/server.js`. You don\'t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.\n\nNote that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that\'s not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don\'t ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it\'s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 2,\n            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 3,\n            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",\n            "decision": "ignore"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 4,\n            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",\n            "decision": "rework"\n        },\n    ],\n    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted.

Do not reply with anything else but the command with which I can run this app with.
For example, if the command is "python app.py", then your response needs to be only `python app.py` without the `

Pay attention to file paths: if the command or argument is a file or folder from the project, use paths relative to the project root (for example, use `./somefile` instead of `/somefile`).

If there is no command to run reply with empty response.
For example, if we only setup package.json and no other files are coded there is no command to run so respond with `` without the `

How can a human user test if this task was completed successfully?

Please list actions, step by step, in order, that the user should take to verify the task. After each action, describe what the expected response is.

**IMPORTANT**

Follow these important rules when compiling a list of actions the user will take:

1. Actions must be as specific as possible. You don't want the user to have to think anything through but rather that they just follow your instructions.
2. In case this task can be tested by making an API request, you should always prefer to test functionality in the browser. In case you can't do that, do not suggest how can a request be made with Postman but rather write a full cURL command that the user can just run.
3. Do not require the user to write any code or edit files to test this task.
4. If the user must run a command, assume the user already has a terminal opened in the project root directory (no need to instruct the user "open the terminal" or "make sure you're in the project directory")
5. The user is using Linux, so the commands must run on that operating system
6. Assume system services, such as the database, are already set up and running. Don't ask user to install or run any software other than the app they're testing.
7. Don't ask the user to test things which aren't implemented yet (eg. opening a theoretical web page that doesn't exist yet, or clicking on a button that isn't implemented yet)

Remember, these rules are very important and you must follow them!

Here is an example output with a few user steps:
---example---
### Step 1
Action: Start the server using `npm start`
Expected result: You should see the message "Connected to database" or similar

### Step 2
Action: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000/
Expected result: Web page opens and you see a "Hello World" message with a contact form

### Step 3
Action: Click on the "Submit" button in the web form
Expected result: Form is submitted, page is reloaded and "Thank you" message is shown
---end_of_example---

If nothing needs to be tested for this task, instead of outputting the steps, just output a single word: DONE

### Step 1
Action: Start the server using `npm start`.
Expected result: You should see a message indicating the server is running, such as "Server running at http://localhost:3000".

### Step 2
Action: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000/auth/register to register a new hospital user. Fill in the required fields, making sure to select "Hospital" as the role. Submit the form.
Expected result: After submission, you should be redirected to the login page.

### Step 3
Action: Log in with the hospital user credentials you just created by visiting http://localhost:3000/auth/login and entering the username and password.
Expected result: After logging in, you should be redirected to the homepage.

### Step 4
Action: In the URL bar, type in http://localhost:3000/hospital/profile/{HospitalUserId} replacing "{HospitalUserId}" with the MongoDB ObjectId of the hospital user you registered. This might require database access or checking the server logs for the ObjectId upon registration.
Expected result: You should see a page displaying the hospital profile with the details you entered during registration. If the profileVisible is set to true (default), the profile should be visible. Otherwise, a message indicating the profile is not available should appear.

### Step 5
Action: Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a "Doctor" user, ensuring you select "Doctor" as the role during registration.
Expected result: After registration and login, you should be redirected to the homepage.

### Step 6
Action: In the URL bar, type in http://localhost:3000/doctor/profile/{DoctorUserId} replacing "{DoctorUserId}" with the MongoDB ObjectId of the doctor user you registered.
Expected result: You should see a page displaying the doctor profile with the details you entered during registration. If the profileVisible is set to true (default), the profile should be visible. Otherwise, a message indicating the profile is not available should appear.

### Step 7
Action: Try accessing both the hospital and doctor profile URLs while logged out by first logging out from the application via http://localhost:3000/auth/logout and then visiting the profile URLs you tested in steps 4 and 6.
Expected result: For both URLs, you should receive a message indicating that you are not authenticated, as viewing profiles is restricted to logged-in users.

This sequence of actions allows you to verify the functionality of viewing hospital and doctor profiles, including the conditional visibility based on the `profileVisible` field and access restriction to authenticated users.

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

```

Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```
You are currently working on task "Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs').

**IMPORTANT**
You have to review this task implementation. You are known to be very strict with your reviews and very good at noticing bugs but you don't mind minor changes like refactoring, adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.

Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.
In this review, your goal is to check:
1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.
2. If new files or functions are created but never called or used.
3. If there is some "dead code" that should be removed.
4. If there is some duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.

If everything is ok respond only with "DONE" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything is ok, respond just with "DONE".

If you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."
------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------

Think about this output and not any output in previous messages. If the command was successfully executed, respond with `DONE`. If it wasn't, respond with `BUG`.

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```
You are currently working on task "Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes." and you have to focus only on that task.

**IMPORTANT**
You have to review this task implementation. You are known to be very strict with your reviews and very good at noticing bugs but you don't mind minor changes like refactoring, adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.

Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.
In this review, your goal is to check:
1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.
2. If new files or functions are created but never called or used.
3. If there is some "dead code" that should be removed.
4. If there is some duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.

If everything is ok respond only with "DONE" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything is ok, respond just with "DONE".

If you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."
------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for "Giełda_dyżurowa" as well.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Here is a short description of the project architecture:
The Giełda_dyżurowa application will follow a traditional three-tier web application architecture, consisting of a presentation layer (frontend), an application layer (backend), and a data layer (database). The frontend will be built using EJS for templating, Bootstrap for CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for interactions, providing a responsive user interface for both doctors and hospitals to interact with. The backend will be developed using Node.js and the Express framework, handling all business logic, including user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties. MongoDB, coupled with Mongoose ORM, will be used as the database to store and manage user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts efficiently.

Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

* Node.js - JavaScript runtime for building apps. This is required to be able to run the app you're building.
* MongoDB - NoSQL database. If you don't want to install MongoDB locally, you can use a cloud version such as MongoDB Atlas.
* express - Express web server for Node
* mongoose - Mongoose ORM for MongoDB
* bcrypt - Library for hashing passwords
* express-session - Middleware for session management in Express
* dotenv - Module to load environment variables from a .env file
* ejs - Templating engine for rendering views



Here are files that are currently implemented:

# Giełda_dyżurowa

A web application designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations. The application facilitates the publication of available duty slots by hospitals, application for duties by doctors, and viewing of profiles for informed decision-making.

## Overview

The application utilizes a Node.js and Express backend, with MongoDB for database management and Mongoose ORM for object modeling. EJS is used for templating, Bootstrap for frontend styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic. The architecture is structured to handle user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties effectively.

## Features

- **User Registration and Profiles:** Separate registration for hospitals and doctors, with profile creation.
- **Duty Slot Publication:** Hospitals can publish available slots for overnight duties.
- **Application for Duties:** Doctors can browse and apply for duty slots.
- **Profile Viewing:** Enables hospitals and doctors to view each other's profiles.
- **External Communication:** Facilitates further communication between hospitals and doctors regarding duty specifics externally.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- A modern web browser

### Quickstart

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your database URL and session secret.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start the application with `npm start`.
5. Access the application through `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you specified in `.env`).

---END_OF_FILES---


We've broken the development of this app down to these tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```

You are currently working on task #6 with the following description:
```
Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.
```
All previous tasks are finished and you don't have to work on them.

Now, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands that need to be run to implement this task.

**IMPORTANT**
Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.

DO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written. When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."
------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**
When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file.

Never use the port 5000 to run the app, it's reserved.

To implement task #6, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Update the User Model

First, you need to add `email` and `phoneNumber` fields to your `User` model. These fields will be optional.

**File:** `/models/User.js`

Add these lines within the `userSchema` definition:
```javascript
  email: { type: String, required: false },
  phoneNumber: { type: String, required: false },
```

This will update the schema around line 10, making it look something like this:
```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  role: { type: String, required: true, enum: ['doctor', 'hospital'] },
  specialty: { type: String, required: false },
  localization: { type: String, required: false },
  profileVisible: { type: Boolean, default: true },
  email: { type: String, required: false },
  phoneNumber: { type: String, required: false },
});
```

### Step 2: Create a Settings Page

Create a settings page where users can update their contact information.

**File:** `/views/settings.ejs`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<%- include('partials/_head.ejs') %>
  <body>
<%- include('partials/_header.ejs') %>
    <main class="container mt-5">
      <h2>Settings</h2>
      <form action="/user/settings" method="POST">
        <div class="mb-3">
          <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" value="<%= user.email %>" class="form-control">
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          <input type="text" name="phoneNumber" placeholder="Phone Number" value="<%= user.phoneNumber %>" class="form-control">
        </div>
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Update</button>
      </form>
    </main>
  </body>
<%- include('partials/_footer.ejs') %>
</html>
```

### Step 3: Add Route to Display and Update Settings

Create a new route to display the settings page and handle the form submission for updating the user's contact information.

**File:** `/routes/profileRoutes.js`

Add these lines at the end of the file:
```javascript
// Display the settings page
router.get('/user/settings', isAuthenticated, async (req, res) => {
  const user = await User.findById(req.session.userId);
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(404).send('User not found.');
  }
  res.render('settings', { user });
});

// Update user settings
router.post('/user/settings', isAuthenticated, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { email, phoneNumber } = req.body;
    await User.findByIdAndUpdate(req.session.userId, { email, phoneNumber });
    res.redirect('/user/settings');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error updating user settings:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Error while updating settings. Please try again later.');
  }
});
```

This code will add functionality to both display the settings form with the current user's email and phone number filled in (if available) and update this information in the database when the form is submitted.

### Step 4: Ensure all dependencies are installed

No new dependencies are required for this task, so you only need to make sure that your project's dependencies are up to date by running:

```bash
npm install
```

These steps will fully implement task #6, adding a section for users to update their contact information, which is essential for facilitating external communication between hospitals and doctors.

To implement task #6, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Update the User Model

First, you need to add `email` and `phoneNumber` fields to your `User` model. These fields will be optional.

**File:** `/models/User.js`

Add these lines within the `userSchema` definition:
```javascript
  email: { type: String, required: false },
  phoneNumber: { type: String, required: false },
```

This will update the schema around line 10, making it look something like this:
```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  role: { type: String, required: true, enum: ['doctor', 'hospital'] },
  specialty: { type: String, required: false },
  localization: { type: String, required: false },
  profileVisible: { type: Boolean, default: true },
  email: { type: String, required: false },
  phoneNumber: { type: String, required: false },
});
```

### Step 2: Create a Settings Page

Create a settings page where users can update their contact information.

**File:** `/views/settings.ejs`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<%- include('partials/_head.ejs') %>
  <body>
<%- include('partials/_header.ejs') %>
    <main class="container mt-5">
      <h2>Settings</h2>
      <form action="/user/settings" method="POST">
        <div class="mb-3">
          <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" value="<%= user.email %>" class="form-control">
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          <input type="text" name="phoneNumber" placeholder="Phone Number" value="<%= user.phoneNumber %>" class="form-control">
        </div>
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Update</button>
      </form>
    </main>
  </body>
<%- include('partials/_footer.ejs') %>
</html>
```

### Step 3: Add Route to Display and Update Settings

Create a new route to display the settings page and handle the form submission for updating the user's contact information.

**File:** `/routes/profileRoutes.js`

Add these lines at the end of the file:
```javascript
// Display the settings page
router.get('/user/settings', isAuthenticated, async (req, res) => {
  const user = await User.findById(req.session.userId);
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(404).send('User not found.');
  }
  res.render('settings', { user });
});

// Update user settings
router.post('/user/settings', isAuthenticated, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { email, phoneNumber } = req.body;
    await User.findByIdAndUpdate(req.session.userId, { email, phoneNumber });
    res.redirect('/user/settings');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error updating user settings:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Error while updating settings. Please try again later.');
  }
});
```

This code will add functionality to both display the settings form with the current user's email and phone number filled in (if available) and update this information in the database when the form is submitted.

### Step 4: Ensure all dependencies are installed

No new dependencies are required for this task, so you only need to make sure that your project's dependencies are up to date by running:

```bash
npm install
```

These steps will fully implement task #6, adding a section for users to update their contact information, which is essential for facilitating external communication between hospitals and doctors.

>>>>>>>>>> User Prompt >>>>>>>>>>
Ok, now, take your previous message that starts with `To implement task #6, follow` and ends with `communication between hospitals and doctors.` and convert it to a list of actionable steps that will be executed by a machine. Analyze the entire message, think step by step and make sure that you don't omit any information when converting this message to steps.

Each step can be either:

* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a Linux machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)
* `save_file` - create or update ONE file
* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done. Also you MUST NOT use `human_intervention` to ask the human to write or review code.

**IMPORTANT**: In `code_change_description` field of `save_file` step, you must provide empty string. If multiple changes are required for same file, you must provide single `save_file` step for each file.

When creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember, NEVER output human intervention steps to do manual tests or coding tasks, even if the previous message asks for it! The testing will be done *after* these steps and you MUST NOT include testing in these steps.

Analyze the entire message, think step by step and make sure that you don\'t omit any information when converting this message to steps.\n\nEach step can be either:\n\n* `command` - command to run (must be able to run on a Linux machine, assume current working directory is project root folder)\n* `save_file` - create or update ONE file\n* `human_intervention` - if you need the human to do something, use this type of step and explain in details what you want the human to do. NEVER use `human_intervention` for testing, as testing will be done separately by a dedicated QA after all the steps are done. Also you MUST NOT use `human_intervention` to ask the human to write or review code.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: In `code_change_description` field of `save_file` step, you must provide empty string. If multiple changes are required for same file, you must provide single `save_file` step for each file.\n\nWhen creating and naming new files, ensure the file naming (camelCase, kebab-case, underscore_case, etc) is consistent with the best practices and coding style of the language.\n\nAll the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Remember, NEVER output human intervention steps to do manual tests or coding tasks, even if the previous message asks for it!

I need to modify file `/models/User.js` that currently looks like this:
```
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  role: { type: String, required: true, enum: ['doctor', 'hospital'] },
  specialty: { type: String, required: false },
  localization: { type: String, required: false },
  profileVisible: { type: Boolean, default: true }
});

userSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  const user = this;
  if (!user.isModified('password')) return next();
  bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10, (err, hash) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error hashing password:', err);
      console.error(err.stack);
      return next(err);
    }
    user.password = hash;
    next();
  });
});

userSchema.pre('validate', function(next) {
  if (this.role === 'doctor' && (!this.specialty || !this.localization)) {
    const err = new Error('Specialty and Localization are required for doctors.');
    console.error('Validation error:', err);
    console.error(err.stack);
    next(err);
  } else {
    next();
  }
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

module.exports = User;
```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/models/User.js`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  role: { type: String, required: true, enum: ['doctor', 'hospital'] },
  specialty: { type: String, required: false },
  localization: { type: String, required: false },
  profileVisible: { type: Boolean, default: true }
});

userSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  const user = this;
  if (!user.isModified('password')) return next();
  bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10, (err, hash) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error hashing password:', err);
      console.error(err.stack);
      return next(err);
    }
    user.password = hash;
    next();
  });
});

userSchema.pre('validate', function(next) {
  if (this.role === 'doctor' && (!this.specialty || !this.localization)) {
    const err = new Error('Specialty and Localization are required for doctors.');
    console.error('Validation error:', err);
    console.error(err.stack);
    next(err);
  } else {
    next();
  }
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

module.exports = User;
```

Here is the diff of the changes:

## Hunk 1
```diff
@@ -7,7 +7,9 @@
   role: { type: String, required: true, enum: ['doctor', 'hospital'] },
   specialty: { type: String, required: false },
   localization: { type: String, required: false },
-  profileVisible: { type: Boolean, default: true }
+  profileVisible: { type: Boolean, default: true },
+  email: { type: String, required: false },
+  phoneNumber: { type: String, required: false },
 });
 
 userSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
```


As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/models/User.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/models/User.js`.\n\nHere is the original content of this file:\n```\nconst mongoose = require(\'mongoose\');\nconst bcrypt = require(\'bcrypt\');\n\nconst userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n  username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true },\n  password: { type: String, required: true },\n  role: { type: String, required: true, enum: [\'doctor\', \'hospital\'] },\n  specialty: { type: String, required: false },\n  localization: { type: String, required: false },\n  profileVisible: { type: Boolean, default: true }\n});\n\nuserSchema.pre(\'save\', function(next) {\n  const user = this;\n  if (!user.isModified(\'password\')) return next();\n  bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10, (err, hash) => {\n    if (err) {\n      console.error(\'Error hashing password:\', err);\n      console.error(err.stack);\n      return next(err);\n    }\n    user.password = hash;\n    next();\n  });\n});\n\nuserSchema.pre(\'validate\', function(next) {\n  if (this.role === \'doctor\' && (!this.specialty || !this.localization)) {\n    const err = new Error(\'Specialty and Localization are required for doctors.\');\n    console.error(\'Validation error:\', err);\n    console.error(err.stack);\n    next(err);\n  } else {\n    next();\n  }\n});\n\nconst User = mongoose.model(\'User\', userSchema);\n\nmodule.exports = User;\n```\n\nHere is the diff of the changes:\n\n## Hunk 1\n```diff\n@@ -7,7 +7,9 @@\n   role: { type: String, required: true, enum: [\'doctor\', \'hospital\'] },\n   specialty: { type: String, required: false },\n   localization: { type: String, required: false },\n-  profileVisible: { type: Boolean, default: true }\n+  profileVisible: { type: Boolean, default: true },\n+  email: { type: String, required: false },\n+  phoneNumber: { type: String, required: false },\n });\n \n userSchema.pre(\'save\', function(next) {\n```\n\n\nAs you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.\n\nThink carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:\n* applied - if the change is correct\n* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn\'t asked for\n* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect\n\nFinally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you\'re just reviewing one file, `/models/User.js`. You don\'t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.\n\nNote that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that\'s not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don\'t ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it\'s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 2,\n            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 3,\n            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",\n            "decision": "ignore"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 4,\n            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",\n            "decision": "rework"\n        },\n    ],\n    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{"hunks": [{"number": 1, "reason": "The addition of \'email\' and \'phoneNumber\' fields to the User model aligns with the task\'s requirements to allow for external communication.

I need to modify file `/views/settings.ejs` that currently looks like this:
```

```

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

A developer on your team has been working on the task described in previous message. Based on those instructions, the developer has made changes to file `/views/settings.ejs`.

Here is the original content of this file:
```

```

Here is the diff of the changes:

## Hunk 1
```diff

+<%- include('partials/_footer.ejs') %>
+</html>
```


As you can see, there is only one hunk in this diff, and it starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/views/settings.ejs`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:\n* applied - if the change is correct\n* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn\'t asked for\n* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect\n\nFinally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you\'re just reviewing one file, `/views/settings.ejs`. You don\'t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.\n\nNote that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that\'s not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don\'t ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it\'s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 2,\n            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 3,\n            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",\n            "decision": "ignore"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 4,\n            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",\n            "decision": "rework"\n        },\n    ],\n    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted.

I want you to implement changes described in previous message and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

**IMPORTANT**:If the instructions have comments like `// ..add code here...` or `# placeholder for code`, instead of copying the comment, interpret the instructions and output the relevant code.

**IMPORTANT**: Your reply MUST NOT omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..` or `# insert existing code here`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation, suggestions or notes. Your output MUST start with ``` and MUST end with ``` and include only the complete file contents.

**IMPORTANT**: For hardcoded configuration values that the user needs to change, mark the line that needs user configuration with `INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` comment,  where `config_description` is a description of the value that needs to be set by the user. Use appropriate syntax for comments in the file you're saving (for example `// INPUT_REQUIRED {config_description}` in JavaScript). NEVER ask the user to write code or provide implementation, even if the instructions suggest it! If the file type doesn't support comments (eg JSON), don't add any.

**IMPORTANT**: Logging
Whenever you write code, make sure to log code execution so that when a developer looks at the CLI output, they can understand what is happening on the server. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough logs, you need to add the logs handlers inside that code yourself.

**IMPORTANT**: Error handling
Whenever you write code, make sure to add error handling for all edge cases you can think of because this app will be used in production so there shouldn't be any crashes. Whenever you log the error, you **MUST** log the entire error message and trace and not only the error message. If the description above mentions the exact code that needs to be added but doesn't contain enough error handlers, you need to add the error handlers inside that code yourself.

As you can see, there are 2 hunks in this diff, and each starts with the `@@` header line.

Think carefully about the instructions and review the proposed changes. For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:
* applied - if the change is correct
* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn't asked for
* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect

Finally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you're just reviewing one file, `/routes/profileRoutes.js`. You don't need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.

Note that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that's not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don't ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it's not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.

Here is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:
```
{
    "hunks": [
        {
            "number": 1,
            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 2,
            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",
            "decision": "apply"
        },
        {
            "number": 3,
            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",
            "decision": "ignore"
        },
        {
            "number": 4,
            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",
            "decision": "rework"
        },
    ],
    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"
}
```

IMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!

For each hunk of change, provide a detailed rationale, and decide whether it should be:\n* applied - if the change is correct\n* ignored - for example if it is a code deletion or change that wasn\'t asked for\n* reworked - if the change does something correctly but also makes a serious mistake, in which case both applying and ignoring the entire hunk would be incorrect\n\nFinally, if the changes miss something that was in the instructions, mention that. Keep in mind you\'re just reviewing one file, `/routes/profileRoutes.js`. You don\'t need to consider if other files are created, dependent packages installed, etc. Focus only on reviewing the changes in this file based on the instructions in the previous message.\n\nNote that the developer may add, modify or delete logging (including `gpt_pilot_debugging_log`) or error handling that\'s not explicitly asked for, but is a part of good development practice. Unless these logging and error handling additions break something, your decision to apply, ignore or rework the hunk should not be based on this. Base your decision only on functional changes - comments or logging are less important. Importantly, don\'t ask for a rework just because of logging or error handling changes. Also, take into account this is a junior developer and while the approach they take may not be the best practice, if it\'s not *wrong*, let it pass. Ask for rework only if the change is clearly bad and would break something.\n\nHere is an example output if 2 of 4 hunks in the change should be applied, one of them should be ignored, one should be reworked, and no other changes are needed:\n```\n{\n    "hunks": [\n        {\n            "number": 1,\n            "reason": "Some explanation why this part of the change is important. The reasoning here should be as detailed as possible as that will help you reach the correct conclusion.",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 2,\n            "reason": "Another explanation, for the 2nd hunk",\n            "decision": "apply"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 3,\n            "reason": "This hunk accidentally deletes important code without any useful change",\n            "decision": "ignore"\n        },\n        {\n            "number": 4,\n            "reason": "This hunk does something correctly but also does something really wrong. It would be incorrect to either apply or ignore it fully, so it should be reworked.",\n            "decision": "rework"\n        },\n    ],\n    "review_notes": "General review notes, if something is missing from the change you can comment about it here"\n}\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: The developer that wrote this is sloppy and has probably deleted some parts of the code that should not be deleted. Pay special attention to that in your review!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{"hunks": [{"number": 1, "reason": "Adding error.stack for more detailed error logging is in line with good development practices, enhancing the debugging process.", "decision": "apply"}, {"number": 2, "reason": "This hunk implements the settings page route and the route to update user settings as requested.

The current task has been split into multiple steps, and each step is one of the following:
* `command` - command to run
* `save_file` -  create or update a file
* `human_intervention` - if the human needs to do something

Here is the list of steps that have been executed:
{'type': 'save_file', 'save_file': {'name': 'User.js', 'path': '/models/User.js', 'code_change_description': '...'}}
{'type': 'save_file', 'save_file': {'name': 'settings.ejs', 'path': '/views/settings.ejs', 'code_change_description': '...'}}
{'type': 'save_file', 'save_file': {'name': 'profileRoutes.js', 'path': '/routes/profileRoutes.js', 'code_change_description': '...'}}

Here is the step you are currently debugging:
{'type': 'command', 'command': {'command': 'npm install', 'timeout': 60000}}

When trying to see if command was ran successfully, take into consideration steps that were previously executed and steps that will be executed after the current step. It can happen that command seems like it failed but it will be fixed with next steps. In that case you should consider that command to be successfully executed.
I ran the command `npm install`. The output was:

For example, if the command is "python app.py", then your response needs to be only `python app.py` without the `

Pay attention to file paths: if the command or argument is a file or folder from the project, use paths relative to the project root (for example, use `./somefile` instead of `/somefile`).

How can a human user test if this task was completed successfully?

Please list actions, step by step, in order, that the user should take to verify the task. After each action, describe what the expected response is.

**IMPORTANT**

Follow these important rules when compiling a list of actions the user will take:

1. Actions must be as specific as possible. You don't want the user to have to think anything through but rather that they just follow your instructions.
2. In case this task can be tested by making an API request, you should always prefer to test functionality in the browser. In case you can't do that, do not suggest how can a request be made with Postman but rather write a full cURL command that the user can just run.
3. Do not require the user to write any code or edit files to test this task.
4. If the user must run a command, assume the user already has a terminal opened in the project root directory (no need to instruct the user "open the terminal" or "make sure you're in the project directory")
5. The user is using Linux, so the commands must run on that operating system
6. Assume system services, such as the database, are already set up and running. Don't ask user to install or run any software other than the app they're testing.
7. Don't ask the user to test things which aren't implemented yet (eg. opening a theoretical web page that doesn't exist yet, or clicking on a button that isn't implemented yet)

Remember, these rules are very important and you must follow them!

Here is an example output with a few user steps:
---example---
### Step 1
Action: Start the server using `npm start`
Expected result: You should see the message "Connected to database" or similar

### Step 2
Action: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000/
Expected result: Web page opens and you see a "Hello World" message with a contact form

### Step 3
Action: Click on the "Submit" button in the web form
Expected result: Form is submitted, page is reloaded and "Thank you" message is shown
---end_of_example---

If nothing needs to be tested for this task, instead of outputting the steps, just output a single word: DONE

2024-03-22 08:13:12,243 [llm_connection.py:540 - stream_gpt_completion() ] INFO: <<<<<<<<<< LLM Response <<<<<<<<<<
### Step 1
Action: Start the server using `npm start`.
Expected result: You should see a message indicating the server is running, such as "Server running at http://localhost:3000".

### Step 2
Action: Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000/auth/login.
Expected result: You will see a login page.

### Step 3
Action: Log in with a user account. If you do not have one, first visit http://localhost:3000/auth/register to create a new account, then log in.
Expected result: After logging in, you should be redirected to the homepage with a message indicating successful login or directly to the homepage.

### Step 4
Action: In the browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000/user/settings.
Expected result: A settings page opens with form fields for "Email" and "Phone Number", and a "Update" button.

### Step 5
Action: Fill in the "Email" and "Phone Number" fields with your email address and phone number, then click the "Update" button.
Expected result: The page should refresh, and you should remain on the settings page, indicating that your settings were successfully updated. (Note: The application does not explicitly confirm successful updates, but remaining on the page without an error message implies success.)

### Step 6
Action: Refresh the settings page or navigate away and then back to http://localhost:3000/user/settings.
Expected result: The "Email" and "Phone Number" fields should display the information you just entered, confirming that the update operation persisted the data correctly in the database.

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```
You are currently working on task "Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database." and you have to focus only on that task.

**IMPORTANT**
You have to review this task implementation. You are known to be very strict with your reviews and very good at noticing bugs but you don't mind minor changes like refactoring, adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.

Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.
In this review, your goal is to check:
1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.
2. If new files or functions are created but never called or used.
3. If there is some "dead code" that should be removed.
4. If there is some duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.

If everything is ok respond only with "DONE" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything is ok, respond just with "DONE".

If you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to write code for the entire application.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Development process of this app was split into smaller tasks. Here is the list of all tasks:
```
1. Implement Hospital and Doctor registration functionality. Modify the existing User model in 'models/User.js' to include a 'role' field that can either be 'doctor' or 'hospital', and additional fields for 'specialty' and 'localization' which are both strings. Update the registration view ('views/register.ejs') to include inputs for the new fields and modify the POST '/auth/register' route in 'routes/authRoutes.js' to handle these new fields. Ensure that the 'role' field determines whether the additional fields are required, with 'specialty' and 'localization' being required for doctors only.

2. Create a model for Duty Slots in 'models/DutySlot.js' with fields for 'date', 'dutyHours', 'requiredSpecialty', and 'hospitalId' (referencing the Hospital's User ID). Implement a route '/duty/publish' that allows hospitals to publish new duty slots. This route should only be accessible to users with the 'hospital' role. Use a POST method where hospitals can submit details for duty slots. Ensure that the route handler saves the duty slot details to the MongoDB database. Add a corresponding EJS view ('views/dutyPublish.ejs') with a form for submitting these details.

3. Implement functionality for doctors to post their availability. Create a new model 'DoctorAvailability.js' with fields for 'doctorId' (referencing the Doctor's User ID), 'date', and 'availableHours'. Add a new route '/doctor/availability' for doctors to post their availability, which should be a POST method route, accessible only to users with the 'doctor' role. Ensure this route saves availability information to the database. Also, create a corresponding EJS view ('views/doctorAvailability.ejs') with a form for doctors to input their available dates and hours.

4. Develop a feature for browsing and applying for duty slots for doctors. Create a route '/duty/browse' that retrieves all duty slots from the database and displays them on a new EJS view ('views/dutyBrowse.ejs'). This route should be accessible only to doctors. On the 'dutyBrowse.ejs' page, list all duty slots and include a button next to each slot that allows doctors to send a message of interest. Implement a simple messaging system where pressing the 'Interest' button sends a predefined message to the hospital that posted the duty slot. Store these messages in a new collection in the database.

5. Implement profile viewing functionality. Modify the User model to include a 'profileVisible' boolean field. Create routes '/hospital/profile/:id' and '/doctor/profile/:id' for viewing hospital and doctor profiles, respectively. These routes should check the 'profileVisible' field before displaying the profile. If 'profileVisible' is false, display a message indicating the profile is not available. For visible profiles, fetch the user's details from the database and display them in new EJS views ('views/hospitalProfile.ejs' and 'views/doctorProfile.ejs'). Ensure only authenticated users can access these routes.

6. Implement external communication initiation. Since the application specification mentions that subsequent communication after duty slot filling is to be conducted externally, add a 'Contact Information' section to both hospital and doctor profiles. This section should include email and phone number fields, which are optional during registration but can be updated later. Update the User model to include 'email' and 'phoneNumber' fields. Create a settings page ('views/settings.ejs') where users can update their contact information, accessible through a new route '/user/settings'. Ensure changes are saved to the database.

```

**IMPORTANT**
You have to review this task implementation. You are known to be very strict with your reviews and very good at noticing bugs but you don't mind minor changes like refactoring, adding or removing logs and so on. You think twice through all information given before giving any conclusions.

Each task goes through multiple reviews and you have to focus only on your part of review.
In this review, your goal is to check:
1. If there are some functionalities that were removed but are still needed.
2. If new files or functions are created but never called or used.
3. If there is some "dead code" that should be removed.
4. If there is some duplicate code resulting from refactoring or moving code into separate classes or files.

If everything is ok respond only with "DONE" and nothing else. Do NOT respond with thoughts, reasoning, explanations or anything similar if everything is ok, respond just with "DONE".

If you find any of these 4 mistakes, describe in detail what has to be changed.

All the steps will be executed in order in which you give them, so it is very important that you think about all steps before you start listing them. For example, you should never code something before you install dependencies or you should never try access a file before it exists in project.

**IMPORTANT**
You must not tell me to run a command in the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed. If there is a need to run an OS related command, specifically tell me that this should be labeled as "Human Intervention" and explain what the human needs to do.
Avoid using "Human Intervention" if possible. You should NOT use "Human Intervention" for anything else than steps that you can't execute. Also, you must not use "Human Intervention" to ask user to test that the application works, because this will be done separately after all the steps are finished - no need to ask the user now.

Here are a few examples when and how to use "Human Intervention":
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where it seems like 3rd party API, in this case Facebook, is not working:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Check latest Facebook API documentation for updates on endpoints, parameters, or authentication.
2. Verify Facebook API key/authentication and request format to ensure they are current and correctly implemented.
3. Use REST client tools like Postman or cURL to directly test the Facebook API endpoints.
4. Check the Facebook API's status page for any reported downtime or service issues.
5. Try calling the Facebook API from a different environment to isolate the issue."
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
Here is an example of good response for the situation where the user needs to enable some settings in their Gmail account:

* "Human Intervention"
"To enable sending emails from your Node.js app via your Gmail, account, you need to do the following:
1. Log in to your Gmail account.
2. Go to 'Manage your Google Account' > Security.
3. Scroll down to 'Less secure app access' and turn it on.
4. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App Passwords'. (You may need to sign in again)
5. At the bottom, click 'Select app' and choose the app you’re using.
6. Click 'Generate'.
Then, use your gmail address and the password generated in the step #6 and put it into the .env file."
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
Here is an example when there are issues with writing to the MongoDB connection:

* "Human Intervention"
"1. Verify the MongoDB credentials provided have write permissions, not just read-only access.
2. Confirm correct database and collection names are used when connecting to database.
3. Update credentials if necessary to include insert document permissions."
------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------

You are working on a App called "Giełda_dyżurowa" and you need to create a detailed documentation for current state of project. Your first task is to create README.md file.

Here is a high level description of "Giełda_dyżurowa":
```
Application Specification:

**Overview and Goals:**
The application is designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations.

**Functional Specification:**

1. **User Registration and Profiles:**
   - **Hospitals** and **Doctors** can register on the platform, providing details such as **specialty** and **localization** during the process.
   - **Doctors** have the capability to post their availability for duties.

2. **Duty Slot Publication:**
   - **Hospitals** can publish available slots for overnight duties on a daily basis, specifying the **date**, **duty hours**, and **required specialty** for each slot.

3. **Application for Duties:**
   - **Doctors** can browse through the duty slots published by hospitals and send messages to express interest in specific duties.
   - Conversely, **doctors** can post their availability, allowing hospitals to review and consider them for duties.

4. **Profile Viewing:**
   - Both **hospitals** and **doctors** can view each other's profiles upon the expression of interest for a duty slot or upon reviewing availability posts. This facilitates better decision-making and enhances transparency.

5. **External Communication:**
   - Subsequent to a duty slot being filled, further communication regarding the duty specifics is expected to be conducted externally (via email, phone, etc.).

**Technical Specification:**

- **Application Type:** Web Application
- **Technologies Used:** Node.js with the Express framework for the backend; MongoDB for the database, with Mongoose ORM for object modeling; EJS for templating; Bootstrap for frontend styling; Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend:** Developed in Node.js and Express, handling functionalities such as user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties.
  - **Database:** MongoDB, with Mongoose ORM for modeling, stores all data related to user profiles, duty slots, and availability posts.
  - **Frontend:** EJS templates for rendering pages, Bootstrap for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content and interactions.

**Application Components:**

1. **Registration Pages:** Separate registration forms for hospitals and doctors, capturing essential details including specialties and locations.
2. **Login System:** Basic authentication system using usernames and passwords.
3. **Duty Slot Publication Page (Hospitals):** Interface for publishing new duty slots, accessible by hospitals.
4. **Duty Slots Browsing and Availability Posting Page (Doctors):** Allows doctors to browse duty slots and post their availability.
5. **Profile Pages:** Both hospitals and doctors can view each other's profiles to make informed decisions regarding duty applications and availability considerations.

**Constraints and Business Rules:**
- Duty slots are exclusively for overnight shifts.
- Post-duty slot allocation, all further communications are to be handled externally.
- Initially, there is no need for a feedback or rating system between hospitals and doctors.

**Integration Specification:**
- No third-party integrations are required at this stage of development.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the application's objectives, functionalities, technical requirements, and user interactions. It serves as a foundational document for the initial development phase, with the potential for future enhancements based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

# Giełda_dyżurowa

A web application designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations. The application facilitates the publication of available duty slots by hospitals, application for duties by doctors, and viewing of profiles for informed decision-making.

## Overview

The application utilizes a Node.js and Express backend, with MongoDB for database management and Mongoose ORM for object modeling. EJS is used for templating, Bootstrap for frontend styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic. The architecture is structured to handle user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties effectively.

## Features

- **User Registration and Profiles:** Separate registration for hospitals and doctors, with profile creation.
- **Duty Slot Publication:** Hospitals can publish available slots for overnight duties.
- **Application for Duties:** Doctors can browse and apply for duty slots.
- **Profile Viewing:** Enables hospitals and doctors to view each other's profiles.
- **External Communication:** Facilitates further communication between hospitals and doctors regarding duty specifics externally.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- A modern web browser

### Quickstart

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your database URL and session secret.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start the application with `npm start`.
5. Access the application through `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you specified in `.env`).

{"name": "README.md", "path": "/README.md", "content": "# Gie\u0142da_dy\u017curowa\n\nA web application designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations. The application facilitates the publication of available duty slots by hospitals, application for duties by doctors, and viewing of profiles for informed decision-making.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe application utilizes a Node.js and Express backend, with MongoDB for database management and Mongoose ORM for object modeling. EJS is used for templating, Bootstrap for frontend styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic. The architecture is structured to handle user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties effectively.\n\n## Features\n\n- **User Registration and Profiles:** Separate registration for hospitals and doctors, with profile creation.\n- **Duty Slot Publication:** Hospitals can publish available slots for overnight duties.\n- **Application for Duties:** Doctors can browse and apply for duty slots.\n- **Profile Viewing:** Enables hospitals and doctors to view each other's profiles.\n- **External Communication:** Facilitates further communication between hospitals and doctors regarding duty specifics externally.\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Node.js\n- MongoDB\n- A modern web browser\n\n### Quickstart\n\n1. Clone the repository to your local machine.\n2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your database URL and session secret.\n3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.\n4. Start the application with `npm start`.\n5. Access the application through `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you specified in `.env`).\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (c) 2024."}
