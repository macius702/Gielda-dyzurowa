A web application designed to streamline the process of matching available doctors with hospital duties, focusing specifically on overnight shifts. It caters to two main user groups: hospitals and doctors, both of which can register and create profiles detailing their specialties and locations. The application facilitates the publication of available duty slots by hospitals, application for duties by doctors, and viewing of profiles for informed decision-making.

## Overview

The application utilizes a Node.js and Express backend, with MongoDB for database management and Mongoose ORM for object modeling. EJS is used for templating, Bootstrap for frontend styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for frontend logic. The architecture is structured to handle user registration, profile management, duty slot publications, and applications for duties effectively.

## Features

- **Duty Slot Publication:** Hospitals can publish available slots for overnight duties.
